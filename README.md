## Contributing

New contributions should be added as pull requests. Guidelines:

* Each new, unrefactored change to the example app should be a pull request
* Each refactoring performed on the example app should be a pull request
* Each new chapter should be a pull request
* Mixing any of the above into one pull request makes reviewing more difficult

## Reviewing

When reviewing new chapters, use `bin/review` to check out, build, and view the
book locally. Example: `bin/review 6` will review the book for pull request 6.

## Releasing

Run `paperback release` to build all output targets in the `release` directory.
Then commit and push up to GitHub.
