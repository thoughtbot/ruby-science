## Code Reviews

The first step towards cleaner code is to make sure you read the code as you
write it. Have you ever typed up a long e-mail, hit "Send," and then realized
later that you made several typos? The problem here is obvious: you didn't read
what you'd written before sending it. Proofreading your e-mails will save you
from all kinds of embarrassments. Proofreading your code will do the same.

An easy way to make it simple to proofread code is to always work on a feature
branch.  Never commit directly to your master branch; doing so will make it
tempting to either push code that hasn't been reviewed, or keep code on your
local machine.  Neither is a good idea.

The first person who should look at every line of code you write is easy to
find: it's you! Before merging your feature branch, look at the diff of what
you've done. Read through each changed line, each new method, and each new
class to make sure that you like what you see. One easy way to make sure that
you look at everything before committing it is to use `git add --patch` instead
of `git add`. This will force you to confirm each change you make.

If you're working on a team, ask your teammates to review your code as well.
After working on the same piece of code for a while, it's easy to develop
tunnel vision. Getting a fresh and different perspective will help catch
mistakes early. After you review your own code, don't merge your feature branch
just yet. Push it up and invite your team members to view the diff as well.
When reviewing somebody else's code, take the same approach you took above:
page through the diff, and make sure you like everything you see.

Team code reviews provide another benefit: you get immediate feedback on how
understandable a piece of code is. Chances are good that you'll understand your
own code. After all, you just wrote it. However, you want your team members to
understand your code as well. Also, even though the code is clear now, it may
not be as obvious looking over it again in six months. Your team members will
be a good indicator of what your own understanding will be in the future. If it
doesn't make sense to them now, it won't make sense to you later.

Code reviews provide an opportunity to catch mistakes and improve code before it
ever gets merged, but there's still a big question out there: what should you be
looking for?
