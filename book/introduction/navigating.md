## How To Read This Book

This book contains three catalogs: smells, solutions, and principles.

Start by looking up a smell that sounds familiar. Each chapter on smells explain
the potential problems each smell may reveal and will reference possible
solutions.

Once you've identified the problem revealed by a smell, read the relevant
solution chapter to learn how to fix it. Each solution chapter will explain
which problems it addresses and potential problems which can be introduced.

Lastly, smell and solution chapters will reference related principles. The smell
chapters will reference principles that you can follow to avoid the root problem
in the future. The solution chapters will explain how each solution changes your
code to follow related principles.

By following this process, you'll learn how to detect and fix actual problems in
your code using smells and reusable solutions, and you'll learn about principles
that you can follow to improve the code you write from the beginning.
