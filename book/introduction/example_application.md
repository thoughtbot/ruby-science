## Example Application

This book comes with a bundled example application, which you can find [on
GitHub]. Make sure that you sign into GitHub before attempting to view example
application and commit links, or you'll receive a 404 error.

[on GitHub]:  https://github.com/thoughtbot/ruby-science/tree/master/example_app

Most of the code samples included in the book come directly from commits in the
example application. Several chapters link to the full commits for related
changes. At any point, you can check out the application locally and check out
those commits to explore solutions in progress.

For some solutions, the entire change is not included in the chapter for the
sake of focus and brevity. However, you can see every change made for a solution
in the example commits, including tests.

Make sure to take a look at the application's [README], as it contains a summary
of the application and instructions for setting it up.
