<dt><p>What is the current status of the book?</p></dt>
<dd><p>As of Dec 7th, 2012, the PDF version of the book is 40 pages. We are actively 
adding content to the book and example application (and your purchase gets you 
access to all future updates).</p></dd>

<dt><p>How is the content delivered?</p></dt>
<dd><p>We're writing the book on GitHub and you'll get access to the repository â€“ 
you get updates the second we push them.</p><p>We are writing the content using 
Markdown and <a href="http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/">pandoc</a>, which provides 
a publishing pipeline for HTML, PDF, ePub (iBooks, Nook), and Mobi (Kindle).</p></dd>

<dt><p>What should I know before reading?</p></dt>
<dd><p>
We assume that you have some general experience with both Ruby and Ruby on Railis.
A familiarity with the basic concetps of OOP is necessary.
</p></dd>

<dt><p>I have a specific burning question!  What if it doesn't cover my favorite topic?</p></dt>
<dd><p>One of our goals with this delivery format is to encourage you to give 
feedback as early in the process as possible. Use the rocking GitHub workflow tools
to comment on the book or request new content.</p></dd>

<dt><p>Do you offer a student discount?</p></dt>
<dd><p>We price the book fairly for the work we put into it and the support costs 
involved, at a price that is less than most school textbooks. And it includes not 
only the book and source code, but the ability to get your questions answered by 
us about Ruby on Rails. So we do not offer student discounts.</p></dd>

<dt><p>What if I don't have a GitHub account?</p></dt>
<dd><p>We really think that this format provides a ton of value!  But if you'd 
like the content available in another format, email us at 
<a href="mailto:learn@thoughtbot.com">learn@thoughtbot.com</a> and we'll chat.</p></dd>
