<section id="introduction" class="level1">
<h1><a href="#introduction">Introduction</a></h1>
<p>Ruby on Rails is almost a decade old, and its community has developed a number of principles for building applications that are fast, fun and easy to change: Don't repeat yourself, keep your views dumb, keep your controllers skinny, and keep business logic in your models. These principles carry most applications to their first release or beyond.</p>
<p>However, these principles only get you so far. After a few releases, most applications begin to suffer. Models become fat, classes become few and large, tests become slow and changes become painful. In many applications, there comes a day when the developers realize that there's no going back; the application is a twisted mess and the only way out is a rewrite or a new job.</p>
<p>Fortunately, it doesn't have to be this way. Developers have been using object-oriented programming for several decades and there's a wealth of knowledge out there that still applies to developing applications today. We can use the lessons learned by these developers to write good Rails applications by applying good object-oriented programming.</p>
<p>Ruby Science will outline a process for detecting emerging problems in code and will dive into the solutions, old and new.</p>
<section id="code-reviews" class="level2">
<h2><a href="#code-reviews">Code Reviews</a></h2>
<p>Our first step toward better code is to review it.</p>
<p>Have you ever sent an email with typos? Did you review what you wrote before clicking &quot;Send&quot;? Reviewing your e-mails prevents mistakes and reviewing your code does the same.</p>
<p>To make it easier to review code, always work in a feature branch. The branch reduces the temptation to push unreviewed code or to wait too long to push code.</p>
<p>The first person who should review every line of your code is you. Before committing new code, read each changed line. Use git's <code>diff</code> and <code>--patch</code> features to examine code before you commit. Read more about these features using <code>git help add</code> and <code>git help commit</code>.</p>
<p>If you're working on a team, push your feature branch and invite your teammates to review the changes via <code>git diff origin/master..HEAD</code>.</p>
<p>Team review reveals how understandable code is to someone other than the author. Your team members' understanding now is a good indicator of your understanding in the future.</p>
<p>However, what should you and your teammates look for during review?</p>
</section>
<section id="follow-your-nose" class="level2">
<h2><a href="#follow-your-nose">Follow Your Nose</a></h2>
<p>Code &quot;smells&quot; are indicators something may be wrong. They are useful because they are easy to see—sometimes easier than the root cause of a problem.</p>
<p>When you review code, watch for smells. Consider whether refactoring the code to remove the smell would result in better code. If you're reviewing a teammate's feature branch, share your best refactoring ideas with him or her.</p>
<p>Smells are associated with one or more refactorings (example: remove the Long Method smell using the Extract Method refactoring). Learn these associations in order to quickly consider them during review and whether the result (example: several small methods) improves the code.</p>
<p>Don't treat code smells as bugs. It will be a waste of time to &quot;fix&quot; every smell. Not every smell is the symptom of a problem and despite your best intentions, you can accidentally introduce another smell or problem.</p>
</section>
<section id="removing-resistance" class="level2">
<h2><a href="#removing-resistance">Removing Resistance</a></h2>
<p>Another opportunity for refactoring is when you're having difficulty making a change to existing code. This is called &quot;resistance.&quot; The refactoring you choose depends on the type of resistance.</p>
<p>Is it hard to determine where new code belongs? The code is not readable enough. Rename methods and variables until it's obvious where your change belongs. This and every subsequent change will be easier. Refactor for readability first.</p>
<p>Is it hard to change the code without breaking existing code? Add extension points or extract code to be easier to reuse, and then try to introduce your change. Repeat this process until the change you want is easy to introduce.</p>
<p>Each change should be easy to introduce. If it's not, refactor.</p>
<p>When you are making your changes, you will be in a feature branch. Try to make your change without refactoring. If your meet resistance, make a &quot;work in progress&quot; commit, check out master and create a new refactoring branch:</p>
<pre><code>git commit -m 'wip: new feature'
git push
git checkout master
git checkout -b refactoring-for-new-feature</code></pre>
<p>Refactor until you fix the resistance you met on your feature branch. Then rebase your feature branch on top of your refactoring branch:</p>
<pre><code>git rebase -i new-feature
git checkout new-feature
git merge refactoring-for-new-feature --ff-only</code></pre>
<p>If the change is easier now, continue in your feature branch. If not, check out your refactoring branch and try again.</p>
</section>
<section id="bugs-and-churn" class="level2">
<h2><a href="#bugs-and-churn">Bugs and Churn</a></h2>
<p>If you're spending a lot of time swatting bugs, remove smells in the methods or classes of the buggy code. You'll make it less likely that a bug will be reintroduced.</p>
<p>After you commit a bug fix to a feature branch, find out if the code you changed to fix the bug is in files that change often. If the buggy code does change often, find smells and eliminate them. Separate the parts that change often from the parts that don't.</p>
<p>Conversely, avoid refactoring areas with low churn. Refactoring changes code and with each change, you risk introducing new bugs. If a file hasn't changed in six months, leave it alone. It may not be pretty, but you'll spend more time looking at it when you break it by trying to fix something that wasn't broken.</p>
</section>
<section id="tools-to-find-smells" class="level2">
<h2><a href="#tools-to-find-smells">Tools to Find Smells</a></h2>
<p>Some smells are easy to find while you're reading code and change sets, but other smells slip through the cracks without extra help.</p>
<p>Duplication is one of the hardest problems to find by hand. If you're using diffs during code reviews, it will be invisible when you copy and paste existing methods. The original method will be unchanged and won't show up in the diff, so unless the reviewer knows and remembers that the original existed, he or she won't notice that the copied method isn't just a new addition. Every duplicated piece of code is a bug waiting to happen.</p>
<p>Churn is similarly invisible, in that each change will look fine, and only the file's full history will reveal the smell.</p>
<p>Various tools are available which can aid you in your search for code smells.</p>
<p>Our favorite is <a href="https://codeclimate.com/">Code Climate</a>, which is a hosted tool and will scan your code for issues every time you push to Git. Code Climate attempts to locate hot spots for refactoring and assigns each class a simple A through F grade. It identifies complexity, duplication, churn and code smells.</p>
<p>If you're unable to use a hosted service, there are gems you can use locally, such as <a href="https://github.com/metricfu/metric_fu">metric_fu</a>, <a href="https://github.com/danmayer/churn">churn</a>, <a href="http://rubygems.org/gems/flog">flog</a>, <a href="http://rubygems.org/gems/flay">flay</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/troessner/reek/wiki">reek</a>. These gems can identify churn, complexity, duplication and smells.</p>
<p>Getting obsessed with the counts and scores from these tools will distract from the actual issues in your code, but it's worthwhile to run them continually and watch out for potential warning signs.</p>
</section>
<section id="how-to-read-this-book" class="level2">
<h2><a href="#how-to-read-this-book">How to Read This Book</a></h2>
<p>This book contains three catalogs: smells, solutions and principles.</p>
<p>Start by looking up a smell that sounds familiar. Each chapter on smells explains the potential problems each smell may reveal and references possible solutions.</p>
<p>Once you've identified the problem revealed by a smell, read the relevant solution chapter to learn how to fix it. Each solution chapter explains which problems it addresses and potential problems that can be introduced.</p>
<p>Lastly, smell and solution chapters reference related principles. The smell chapters reference principles that you can follow to avoid the root problem in the future. The solution chapters explain how each solution changes your code to follow related principles.</p>
<p>By following this process, you'll learn how to detect and fix actual problems in your code using smells and reusable solutions, and you'll learn about principles that you can follow to improve the code you write from the beginning.</p>
</section>
<section id="example-application" class="level2">
<h2><a href="#example-application">Example Application</a></h2>
<p>This book comes with a bundled example application, which you can find <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/ruby-science/tree/master/example_app">on GitHub</a>. Make sure that you sign into GitHub before attempting to view example application and commit links, or you'll receive a 404 error.</p>
<p>Most of the code samples included in the book come directly from commits in the example application. Several chapters link to the full commits for related changes. At any point, you can check out the application locally and check out those commits to explore solutions in progress.</p>
<p>For some solutions, the entire change is not included in the chapter for the sake of focus and brevity. However, you can see every change made for a solution in the example commits, including tests.</p>
<p>Make sure to take a look at the application's <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/ruby-science/blob/master/example_app/README.md">README</a>, as it contains a summary of the application and instructions for setting it up.</p>

<section id="long-method" class="level1">
<h1><a href="#long-method">Long Method</a></h1>
<p>The most common smell in Rails applications is the Long Method.</p>
<p>Long methods are exactly what they sound like: methods that are too long. They're easy to spot.</p>

<li>Methods with more than one level of nesting are usually too long.</li>
<li>Methods with more than one level of abstraction may be too long.</li>
<li>Methods with a flog score of 10 or higher may be too long.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can watch out for long methods as you write them, but finding existing methods is easiest with tools like flog:</p>
<pre><code>% flog app lib
    72.9: flog total
     5.6: flog/method average

    15.7: QuestionsController#create       app/controllers/questions_controller.rb:9
    11.7: QuestionsController#new          app/controllers/questions_controller.rb:2
    11.0: Question#none
     8.1: SurveysController#create         app/controllers/surveys_controller.rb:6</code></pre>
<p>Methods with higher scores are more complicated. Anything with a score higher than 10 is worth looking at, but flog only helps you find potential trouble spots; use your own judgment when refactoring.</p>

<section id="private-methods" class="level2">
<h2><a href="#private-methods">Private Methods</a></h2>
<p>In general, public methods are a greater liability than private methods. This is because it's harder to tell where public methods are used, so you need to take greater care when refactoring them. However, a large suite of private methods is also a strong indicator of a large class.</p>
<p>Private methods can't be reused between classes, which makes it more likely that code will be duplicated. Extracting private methods to new classes makes it easier for developers to do the right thing.</p>
<p>Additionally, private methods can't be tested directly. This makes it more difficult to write focused, simple unit tests, since the tests will need to go through one or more public methods. The further a test is from the code it tests, the harder it is to understand.</p>
<p>Lastly, private methods are often the easiest to extract to new classes. Large classes can be difficult to split up because of entangled dependencies between public and private methods.</p>
<p>Attempts to extract public methods will frequently halt when shared dependencies are discovered on private methods. Extracting the private behavior of a class into a small, reusable class is often the easiest first step towards splitting up a large class.</p>
<p>Keeping a class's public interface as small as possible is a best practice. However, keep an eye on your private interface as well. A maze of private dependencies is a good sign that your public interface is not cohesive and can be split into two or more classes.</p>
</section>
<section id="god-class" class="level2">
<h2><a href="#god-class">God Class</a></h2>
<p>A particular specimen of large class affects most Rails applications: the God class. A God class is any class that seems to know everything about an application. It has a reference to the majority of the other models and it's difficult to answer any question or perform any action in the application without going through this class.</p>
<p>Most applications have two God classes: the user, and the central focus of the application. For a todo list application, it will be user and todo; for photo sharing application, it will be user and photo.</p>
<p>You need to be particularly vigilant about refactoring these classes. If you don't start splitting up your God classes early on, it will become impossible to separate them without rewriting most of your application.</p>
<p>Treatment and prevention of God classes is the same as for any large class.</p>

<section id="feature-envy" class="level1">
<h1><a href="#feature-envy">Feature Envy</a></h1>
<p>Feature envy reveals a method (or method-to-be) that would work better on a different class.</p>
<p>Methods suffering from feature envy contain logic that is difficult to reuse because the logic is trapped within a method on the wrong class. These methods are also often private methods, which makes them unavailable to other classes. Moving the method (or the affected portion of a method) to a more appropriate class improves readability, makes the logic easier to reuse and reduces coupling.</p>

<p>Actual <code>case</code> statements are extremely easy to find. Just grep your codebase for &quot;case.&quot; However, you should also be on the lookout for <code>case</code>'s sinister cousin, the repetitive <code>if-elsif</code>.</p>
</section>
<section id="type-codes" class="level2">
<h2><a href="#type-codes">Type Codes</a></h2>
<p>Some applications contain type codes—fields that store type information about objects. These fields are easy to add and seem innocent, but result in code that's harder to maintain. A better solution is to take advantage of Ruby's ability to invoke different behavior based on an object's class, called &quot;dynamic dispatch.&quot; Using a case statement with a type code inelegantly reproduces dynamic dispatch.</p>
<p>The special <code>type</code> column that ActiveRecord uses is not necessarily a type code. The <code>type</code> column is used to serialize an object's class to the database so that the correct class can be instantiated later on. If you're just using the <code>type</code> column to let ActiveRecord decide which class to instantiate, this isn't a smell. However, make sure to avoid referencing the <code>type</code> column from <code>case</code> or <code>if</code> statements.</p>

<h1><a href="#single-table-inheritance-sti">Single Table Inheritance (STI)</a></h1>
<p>Using subclasses is a common method of achieving reuse in object-oriented software. Rails provides a mechanism for storing instances of different classes in the same table, called Single Table Inheritance. Rails takes care of most of the details by writing the class's name to the type column and instantiating the correct class when results come back from the database.</p>
<p>Inheritance has its own pitfalls (see <a href="#composition-over-inheritance">composition over inheritance</a>) and STI introduces a few new gotchas that may compel you to consider an alternate solution.</p>

<li>You need to make sure validations for the new subclass are used.</li>
<li>You need to delete data from the old subclass, including associations.</li>
<li>You need to support data from the new subclass.</li>
<li>Common attributes need to remain the same.</li>
</ul>
<p>The implementation achieves all these requirements, but is awkward:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can't actually change the class of an instance in Ruby, so you need to return the instance of the new class.</li>
<li>The implementation requires deleting and creating records, but part of the transaction (<code>destroy</code>) must execute before you can validate the new instance. This results in control flow using exceptions.</li>
<li>The STI abstraction leaks into the model, because it needs to understand that it has a <code>type</code> column. STI models normally don't need to understand that they're implemented using STI.</li>
<li>It's hard to understand why this method is implemented the way it is, so other developers fixing bugs or refactoring in the future will have a hard time navigating it.</li>

<p>There are a number of issues with the <code>summary</code> method:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adding a new question type will require modifying the method, leading to <a href="#divergent-change">divergent change</a>.</li>
<li>The logic and data for summarizing every type of question and answer is jammed into the <code>Question</code> class, resulting in a <a href="#large-class">large class</a> with <a href="#obscure-code">obscure code</a>.</li>
<li>This method isn't the only place in the application where question types are checked, meaning that new types will cause <a href="#shotgun-surgery">shotgun surgery</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are several ways to refactor to use polymorphism. In this chapter, we'll demonstrate a solution that uses subclasses to replace type codes, which is one of the simplest solutions to implement. However, make sure to see the <a href="#drawbacks">Drawbacks</a> section in this chapter for alternative implementations.</p>
</section>
<section id="replace-type-code-with-subclasses" class="level2">
<h2><a href="#replace-type-code-with-subclasses">Replace Type Code with Subclasses</a></h2>
<p>Let's replace this case statement with polymorphism by introducing a subclass for each type of question.</p>
<p>Our <code>Question</code> class is a subclass of <code>ActiveRecord::Base</code>. If we want to create subclasses of <code>Question</code>, we have to tell ActiveRecord which subclass to instantiate when it fetches records from the <code>questions</code> table. The mechanism Rails uses for storing instances of different classes in the same table is called <a href="#single-table-inheritance-sti">single table inheritance</a>. Rails will take care of most of the details, but there are a few extra steps we need to take when refactoring to single table inheritance.</p>
</section>
<section id="single-table-inheritance-sti-1" class="level2">
<h2><a href="#single-table-inheritance-sti-1">Single Table Inheritance (STI)</a></h2>
<p>The first step to convert to <a href="#single-table-inheritance-sti">STI</a> is generally to create a new subclass for each type. However, the existing type codes are named &quot;Open,&quot; &quot;Scale&quot; and &quot;MultipleChoice,&quot; which won't make good class names. Names like &quot;OpenQuestion&quot; would be better, so let's start by changing the existing type codes:</p>

<span class="kw">end</span></code></pre>
<p>See <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/ruby-science/commit/b535171">commit b535171</a> for the full change.</p>
<p>The <code>Question</code> class stores its type code as <code>question_type</code>. The Rails convention is to use a column named <code>type</code>, but Rails will automatically start using STI if that column is present. That means that renaming <code>question_type</code> to <code>type</code> at this point would result in debugging two things at once: possible breaks from renaming and possible breaks from using STI. Therefore, let's start by just marking <code>question_type</code> as the inheritance column, allowing us to debug STI failures by themselves:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="co"># app/models/question.rb</span>
set_inheritance_column  <span class="st">'question_type'</span></code></pre>
<p>Running the tests after this will reveal that Rails wants the subclasses to be defined, so let's add some placeholder classes:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="co"># app/models/open_question.rb</span>
<span class="kw">class</span> <span class="dt">OpenQuestion</span> &lt; <span class="dt">Question</span>
<span class="kw">end</span></code></pre>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="co"># app/models/scale_question.rb</span>
<span class="kw">class</span> <span class="dt">ScaleQuestion</span> &lt; <span class="dt">Question</span>
<span class="kw">end</span></code></pre>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="co"># app/models/multiple_choice_question.rb</span>
<span class="kw">class</span> <span class="dt">MultipleChoiceQuestion</span> &lt; <span class="dt">Question</span>
<span class="kw">end</span></code></pre>
<p>Rails generates URLs and local variable names for partials based on class names. Our views will now be getting instances of subclasses like <code>OpenQuestion</code> rather than <code>Question</code>, so we'll need to update a few more references. For example, we'll have to change lines like:</p>
<pre class="erb"><code>&lt;%= form_for @question do |form| %&gt;</code></pre>
<p>To:</p>
<pre class="erb"><code>&lt;%= form_for @question, as: :question do |form| %&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Otherwise, it will generate <code>/open_questions</code> as a URL instead of <code>/questions</code>. See <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/ruby-science/commit/c18ebeb">commit c18ebeb</a> for the full change.</p>
<p>At this point, the tests are passing with STI in place, so we can rename <code>question_type</code> to <code>type</code>, following the Rails convention:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="co"># db/migrate/20121128225425_rename_question_type_to_type.rb</span>
<span class="kw">class</span> <span class="dt">RenameQuestionTypeToType</span> &lt; <span class="dt">ActiveRecord</span>::<span class="dt">Migration</span>
  <span class="kw">def</span> up
    rename_column <span class="st">:questions</span>, <span class="st">:question_type</span>, <span class="st">:type</span>
  <span class="kw">end</span>

  <span class="kw">def</span> down
    rename_column <span class="st">:questions</span>, <span class="st">:type</span>, <span class="st">:question_type</span>
  <span class="kw">end</span>
<span class="kw">end</span></code></pre>
<p>Now we need to build the appropriate subclass instead of <code>Question</code>. We can use a little Ruby meta-programming to make that fairly painless:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="co"># app/controllers/questions_controller.rb</span>
<span class="kw">def</span> build_question
  <span class="ot">@question</span> = type.constantize.new(question_params)
  <span class="ot">@question</span>.survey = <span class="ot">@survey</span>
<span class="kw">end</span>

<span class="kw">def</span> type
  params[<span class="st">:question</span>][<span class="st">:type</span>]
<span class="kw">end</span></code></pre>
<p>At this point, we're ready to proceed with a regular refactoring.</p>
<section id="extracting-type-specific-code" class="level3">
<h3><a href="#extracting-type-specific-code">Extracting Type-Specific Code</a></h3>
<p>The next step is to move type-specific code from <code>Question</code> into the subclass for each specific type.</p>
<p>Let's look at the <code>summary</code> method again:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="co"># app/models/question.rb</span>
<span class="kw">def</span> summary
  <span class="kw">case</span> question_type
  <span class="kw">when</span> <span class="st">'MultipleChoice'</span>
    summarize_multiple_choice_answers
  <span class="kw">when</span> <span class="st">'Open'</span>
    summarize_open_answers
  <span class="kw">when</span> <span class="st">'Scale'</span>
    summarize_scale_answers
  <span class="kw">end</span>
<span class="kw">end</span></code></pre>
<p>For each path of the condition, there is a sequence of steps.</p>
<p>The first step is to use <a href="#extract-method">extract method</a> to move each path to its own method. In this case, we already extracted methods called <code>summarize_multiple_choice_answers</code>, <code>summarize_open_answers</code>, and <code>summarize_scale_answers</code>, so we can proceed immediately.</p>
<p>The next step is to use <a href="#move-method">move method</a> to move the extracted method to the appropriate class. First, let's move the method <code>summarize_multiple_choice_answers</code> to <code>MultipleChoiceQuestion</code> and rename it to <code>summary</code>:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="kw">class</span> <span class="dt">MultipleChoiceQuestion</span> &lt; <span class="dt">Question</span>
  <span class="kw">def</span> summary
    total = answers.count
    counts = answers.group(<span class="st">:text</span>).order(<span class="st">'COUNT(*) DESC'</span>).count
    percents = counts.map <span class="kw">do</span> |text, count|
      percent = (<span class="fl">100.0</span> * count / total).round
      <span class="st">&quot;</span><span class="ot">#{</span>percent<span class="ot">}</span><span class="st">% </span><span class="ot">#{</span>text<span class="ot">}</span><span class="st">&quot;</span>
    <span class="kw">end</span>
    percents.join(<span class="st">', '</span>)
  <span class="kw">end</span>
<span class="kw">end</span></code></pre>
<p><code>MultipleChoiceQuestion#summary</code> now overrides <code>Question#summary</code>, so the correct implementation will now be chosen for multiple choice questions.</p>
<p>Now that the code for multiple choice types is in place, we repeat the steps for each other path. Once every path is moved, we can remove <code>Question#summary</code> entirely.</p>
<p>In this case, we've already created all our subclasses, but you can use <a href="#extract-class">extract class</a> to create them if you're extracting each conditional path into a new class.</p>
<p>You can see the full change for this step in <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/ruby-science/commit/a08f801">commit a08f801</a>.</p>
<p>The <code>summary</code> method is now much better. Adding new question types is easier. The new subclass will implement <code>summary</code> and the <code>Question</code> class doesn't need to change. The summary code for each type now lives with its type, so no one class is cluttered up with the details.</p>

<h2><a href="#polymorphic-partials">Polymorphic Partials</a></h2>
<p>Applications rarely check the type code in just one place. Running grep on our example application reveals several more places. Most interestingly, the views check the type before deciding how to render a question:</p>

<p>In the previous example, we moved type-specific code into <code>Question</code> subclasses. However, moving view code would violate MVC (introducing <a href="#divergent-change">divergent change</a> into the subclasses) and, more importantly, it would be ugly and hard to understand.</p>
<p>Rails has the ability to render views polymorphically. A line like this—</p>
<pre class="erb"><code>&lt;%= render @question %&gt;</code></pre>
<p>—will ask <code>@question</code> which view should be rendered by calling <code>to_partial_path</code>. As subclasses of <code>ActiveRecord::Base</code>, our <code>Question</code> subclasses will return a path based on their class name. This means that the above line will attempt to render <code>open_questions/_open_question.html.erb</code> for an open question, and so on.</p>
<p>We can use this to move the type-specific view code into a view for each type:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode rhtml"><code class="sourceCode rhtml"># app/views/open_questions/_open_question.html.erb
<span class="kw">&lt;%=</span> submission_fields.text_field <span class="st">:text</span> <span class="kw">%&gt;</span></code></pre>

<section id="multiple-polymorphic-views" class="level3">
<h3><a href="#multiple-polymorphic-views">Multiple Polymorphic Views</a></h3>
<p>Our application also has different fields on the question form depending on the question type. Currently, that also performs type-checking:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode rhtml"><code class="sourceCode rhtml"># app/views/questions/new.html.erb
<span class="kw">&lt;%</span> <span class="kw">if</span> <span class="ot">@question</span>.type <span class="ch">==</span> <span class="st">'MultipleChoiceQuestion'</span> <span class="kw">-%&gt;</span>

<span class="kw">&lt;%</span> <span class="kw">end</span> <span class="kw">-%&gt;</span></code></pre>
<p>We already used views like <code>open_questions/_open_question.html.erb</code> for showing a question, so we can't just put the edit code there. Rails doesn't support prefixes or suffixes in <code>render</code>, but we can do it ourselves easily enough:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode rhtml"><code class="sourceCode rhtml"># app/views/questions/new.html.erb
<span class="kw">&lt;%=</span> render <span class="st">&quot;</span><span class="ot">#{@question</span>.to_partial_path<span class="ot">}</span><span class="st">_form&quot;</span>, question: <span class="ot">@question</span>, form: form <span class="kw">%&gt;</span></code></pre>
<p>This will render <code>app/views/open_questions/_open_question_form.html.erb</code> for an open question, and so on.</p>

<section id="drawbacks" class="level3">
<h3><a href="#drawbacks">Drawbacks</a></h3>
<p>It's worth noting that, although this refactoring improved this particular example, replacing conditionals with polymorphism is not without its drawbacks.</p>
<p>Using polymorphism like this makes it easier to add new types, because adding a new type means that you just need to add a new class and implement the required methods. Adding a new type won't require changes to any existing classes, and it's easy to understand what the types are because each type is encapsulated within a class.</p>
<p>However, this change makes it harder to add new behaviors. Adding a new behavior will mean finding every type and adding a new method. Understanding the behavior becomes more difficult because the implementations are spread out among the types. Object-oriented languages lean toward polymorphic implementations, but if you find yourself adding behaviors much more often than adding types, you should look into using observers or visitors instead.</p>
<p>Using subclasses forces you to use inheritance instead of composition for reuse and separation of concerns. See <a href="#composition-over-inheritance">composition over inheritance</a> for more on this subject.</p>
<p>Also, using STI has specific disadvantages. See the <a href="#single-table-inheritance-sti">chapter on STI</a> for details.</p>

  answers.most_recent.try(<span class="st">:text</span>) || <span class="dt">Answer</span>::<span class="dt">MISSING_TEXT</span>
<span class="kw">end</span></code></pre>
<p>The <code>most_recent_answer_text</code> method asks its <code>answers</code> association for <code>most_recent</code> answer. It only wants the <code>text</code> from that answer, but it must first check to make sure that an answer actually exists to get <code>text</code> from. It needs to perform this check because <code>most_recent</code> might return <code>nil</code>:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="co"># app/models/answer.rb</span>
<span class="kw">def</span> <span class="dv">self</span>.most_recent
  order(<span class="st">:created_at</span>).last
<span class="kw">end</span></code></pre>
<p>This call clutters up the method, and returning <code>nil</code> is contagious: Any method that calls <code>most_recent</code> must also check for <code>nil</code>. The concept of a missing answer is likely to come up more than once, as in this example:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="co"># app/models/user.rb</span>
<span class="kw">def</span> answer_text_for(question)
  question.answers.for_user(<span class="dv">self</span>).try(<span class="st">:text</span>) || <span class="dt">Answer</span>::<span class="dt">MISSING_TEXT</span>
<span class="kw">end</span></code></pre>
<p>Again, <code>for_user</code> might return <code>nil</code>:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="co"># app/models/answer.rb</span>
<span class="kw">def</span> <span class="dv">self</span>.for_user(user)
  joins(<span class="st">:completion</span>).where(completions: { user_id: user.id }).last
<span class="kw">end</span></code></pre>
<p>The <code>User#answer_text_for</code> method duplicates the check for a missing answer—and worse, it's repeating the logic of what happens when you need text without an answer.</p>
<p>We can remove these checks entirely from <code>Question</code> and <code>User</code> by introducing a null object:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="co"># app/models/question.rb</span>
<span class="kw">def</span> most_recent_answer_text
  answers.most_recent.text
<span class="kw">end</span></code></pre>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="co"># app/models/user.rb</span>
<span class="kw">def</span> answer_text_for(question)
  question.answers.for_user(<span class="dv">self</span>).text
<span class="kw">end</span></code></pre>
<p>We're now just assuming that <code>Answer</code> class methods will return something answer-like; specifically, we expect an object that returns useful <code>text</code>. We can refactor <code>Answer</code> to handle the <code>nil</code> check:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="co"># app/models/answer.rb</span>
<span class="kw">class</span> <span class="dt">Answer</span> &lt; <span class="dt">ActiveRecord</span>::<span class="dt">Base</span>
  <span class="kw">include</span> <span class="dt">ActiveModel</span>::<span class="dt">ForbiddenAttributesProtection</span>

  belongs_to <span class="st">:completion</span>
  belongs_to <span class="st">:question</span>

  validates <span class="st">:text</span>, presence: <span class="dv">true</span>

  <span class="kw">def</span> <span class="dv">self</span>.for_user(user)
    joins(<span class="st">:completion</span>).where(completions: { user_id: user.id }).last ||
      <span class="dt">NullAnswer</span>.new
  <span class="kw">end</span>

  <span class="kw">def</span> <span class="dv">self</span>.most_recent
    order(<span class="st">:created_at</span>).last || <span class="dt">NullAnswer</span>.new
  <span class="kw">end</span>
<span class="kw">end</span></code></pre>
<p>Note that <code>for_user</code> and <code>most_recent</code> return a <code>NullAnswer</code> if no answer can be found, so these methods will never return <code>nil</code>. The implementation for <code>NullAnswer</code> is simple:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="co"># app/models/null_answer.rb</span>
<span class="kw">class</span> <span class="dt">NullAnswer</span>
  <span class="kw">def</span> text
    <span class="st">'No response'</span>
  <span class="kw">end</span>
<span class="kw">end</span></code></pre>
<p>We can take things just a little further and remove a bit of duplication with a quick <a href="#extract-method">extract method</a>:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="co"># app/models/answer.rb</span>

  <span class="kw">include</span> <span class="dt">ActiveModel</span>::<span class="dt">ForbiddenAttributesProtection</span>

  belongs_to <span class="st">:completion</span>
  belongs_to <span class="st">:question</span>

  validates <span class="st">:text</span>, presence: <span class="dv">true</span>

  <span class="kw">def</span> <span class="dv">self</span>.for_user(user)
    joins(<span class="st">:completion</span>).where(completions: { user_id: user.id }).last_or_null
  <span class="kw">end</span>

  <span class="kw">def</span> <span class="dv">self</span>.most_recent
    order(<span class="st">:created_at</span>).last_or_null
  <span class="kw">end</span>

  <span class="kw">private</span>

    last || <span class="dt">NullAnswer</span>.new
  <span class="kw">end</span>
<span class="kw">end</span></code></pre>
<p>Now we can easily create <code>Answer</code> class methods that return a usable answer, no matter what.</p>

<section id="drawbacks-1" class="level3">
<h3><a href="#drawbacks-1">Drawbacks</a></h3>
<p>Introducing a null object can remove duplication and clutter. But it can also cause pain and confusion:</p>
<ul>
<li>As a developer reading a method like <code>Question#most_recent_answer_text</code>, you may be confused to find that <code>most_recent_answer</code> returned an instance of <code>NullAnswer</code> and not <code>Answer</code>.</li>
<li>It's possible some methods will need to distinguish between <code>NullAnswer</code>s and real <code>Answer</code>s. This is common in views, when special markup is required to denote missing values. In this case, you'll need to add explicit <code>present?</code> checks and define <code>present?</code> to return <code>false</code> on your null object.</li>
<li><code>NullAnswer</code> may eventually need to reimplement large part of the <code>Answer</code> API, leading to potential <a href="#duplicated-code">duplicated code</a> and <a href="#shotgun-surgery">shotgun surgery</a>, which is largely what we hoped to solve in the first place.</li>
</ul>
<p>Don't introduce a null object until you find yourself swatting enough <code>nil</code> values to grow annoyed. And make sure the removal of the <code>nil</code>-handling logic outweighs the drawbacks above.</p>

<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="kw">def</span> create

  <span class="kw">else</span>
    render <span class="st">:new</span>
  <span class="kw">end</span>
<span class="kw">end</span></code></pre>
<p>This method performs a number of tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li>It finds the survey that the question should belong to.</li>
<li>It figures out what type of question we're creating (the <code>submittable_type</code>).</li>
<li>It builds parameters for the new question by applying a white list to the HTTP parameters.</li>
<li>It builds a question from the given survey, parameters and submittable type.</li>
<li>It attempts to save the question.</li>
<li>It redirects back to the survey for a valid question.</li>
<li>It re-renders the form for an invalid question.</li>
</ul>
<p>Any of these tasks can be extracted to a method. Let's start by extracting the task of building the question.</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="kw">def</span> create
  <span class="ot">@survey</span> = <span class="dt">Survey</span>.find(params[<span class="st">:survey_id</span>])

<span class="kw">end</span></code></pre>
<p>The <code>create</code> method is already much more readable. The new <code>build_question</code> method is noisy, though, with the wrong details at the beginning. The task of pulling out question parameters is clouding up the task of building the question. Let's extract another method.</p>

<h3><a href="#example-16">Example</a></h3>
<p>In our example application, we generate summaries from answers to surveys. We allow more than one type of summary, so strategies are employed to handle the variations. There are a number of methods and dependencies that make this work.</p>
<p><code>SummariesController#show</code> depends on <code>Survey#summarize</code>:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="co"># app/controllers/summaries_controller.rb</span>
<span class="ot">@summaries</span> = <span class="ot">@survey</span>.summarize(summarizer)</code></pre>
<p><code>Survey#summarize</code> depends on <code>Question#summarize</code>:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="co"># app/models/survey.rb</span>
<span class="kw">def</span> summarize(summarizer)
  questions.map <span class="kw">do</span> |question|
    question.summarize(summarizer)
  <span class="kw">end</span>
<span class="kw">end</span></code></pre>
<p><code>Question#summarize</code> depends on <code>summarize</code> from its <code>summarizer</code> argument (a strategy):</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="co"># app/models/question.rb</span>
<span class="kw">def</span> summarize(summarizer)
  value = summarizer.summarize(<span class="dv">self</span>)
  <span class="dt">Summary</span>.new(title, value)
<span class="kw">end</span></code></pre>
<p>There are several summarizer classes, each of which respond to <code>summarize</code>.</p>
<p>This is confusing, largely because the word <code>summarize</code> is used to mean several different things:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Survey#summarize</code> accepts a summarizer and returns an array of <code>Summary</code> instances.</li>
<li><code>Question#summarize</code> accepts a summarizer and returns a single <code>Summary</code> instance.</li>
<li><code>summarize</code> on summarizer strategies accepts a <code>Question</code> and returns a <code>String</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's rename these methods so that each name is used uniquely and consistently in terms of what it accepts, what it returns and what it does.</p>
<p>First, we'll rename <code>Survey#summarize</code> to reflect the fact that it returns a collection.</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="co"># app/models/survey.rb</span>
<span class="kw">def</span> summaries_using(summarizer)</code></pre>
<p>Then we'll update the only reference to the old method:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="co"># app/controllers/summaries_controller.rb</span>
<span class="ot">@summaries</span> = <span class="ot">@survey</span>.summaries_using(summarizer)</code></pre>
<p>Next, we'll rename <code>Question#summarize</code> to be consistent with the naming introduced in <code>Survey</code>:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="co"># app/models/question.rb</span>
<span class="kw">def</span> summary_using(summarizer)</code></pre>
<p>Finally, we'll update the only reference in <code>Survey#summaries_using</code>:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="co"># app/models/survey.rb</span>
question.summary_using(summarizer)</code></pre>
<p>We now have consistent and clearer naming:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>summarize</code> means taking a question and returning a string value representing its answers.</li>
<li><code>summary_using</code> means taking a summarizer and using it to build a <code>Summary</code>.</li>
<li><code>summaries_using</code> means taking a set of questions and building a <code>Summary</code> for each one.</li>

<span class="kw">end</span></code></pre>
<p>Let's extract all of the non-controller logic into a new class. We'll start by defining and instantiating a new, empty class:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="co"># app/controllers/invitations_controller.rb</span>
<span class="ot">@survey_inviter</span> = <span class="dt">SurveyInviter</span>.new</code></pre>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="co"># app/models/survey_inviter.rb</span>
<span class="kw">class</span> <span class="dt">SurveyInviter</span>
<span class="kw">end</span></code></pre>
<p>At this point, we've <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/ruby-science/commit/cce33485">created a staging area</a> for using <a href="#move-method">move method</a> to transfer complexity from one class to the other.</p>
<p>Next, we'll move one method from the controller to our new class. It's best to move methods which depend on few private methods or instance variables from the original class, so we'll start with a method which only uses one private method:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="co"># app/models/survey_inviter.rb</span>
<span class="kw">def</span> recipient_list
  <span class="ot">@recipient_list</span> ||= <span class="ot">@recipients</span>.gsub(<span class="ot">/\s+/</span>, <span class="st">''</span>).split(<span class="ot">/[\n,;]+/</span>)
<span class="kw">end</span></code></pre>
<p>We need the recipients for this method, so we'll accept it in the <code>initialize</code> method:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="co"># app/models/survey_inviter.rb</span>
<span class="kw">def</span> initialize(recipients)
  <span class="ot">@recipients</span> = recipients
<span class="kw">end</span></code></pre>
<p>And pass it from our controller:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="co"># app/controllers/invitations_controller.rb</span>
<span class="ot">@survey_inviter</span> = <span class="dt">SurveyInviter</span>.new(recipients)</code></pre>
<p>The original controller method can delegate to the extracted method:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="co"># app/controllers/invitations_controller.rb</span>
<span class="kw">def</span> recipient_list
  <span class="ot">@survey_inviter</span>.recipient_list
<span class="kw">end</span></code></pre>
<p>We've <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/ruby-science/commit/ac014750">moved a little complexity out of our controller</a> and we now have a repeatable process for doing so: We can continue to move methods out until we feel good about what's left in the controller.</p>
<p>Next, let's move out <code>invalid_recipients</code> from the controller, since it depends on <code>recipient_list</code>, which we've already moved:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="co"># app/models/survey_inviter.rb</span>
<span class="kw">def</span> invalid_recipients
  <span class="ot">@invalid_recipients</span> ||= recipient_list.map <span class="kw">do</span> |item|
    <span class="kw">unless</span> item.match(<span class="dt">EMAIL_REGEX</span>)
      item
    <span class="kw">end</span>
  <span class="kw">end</span>.compact
<span class="kw">end</span></code></pre>
<p>Again, the original controller method can delegate:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="co"># app/controllers/invitations_controller.rb</span>
<span class="kw">def</span> invalid_recipients
  <span class="ot">@survey_inviter</span>.invalid_recipients
<span class="kw">end</span></code></pre>
<p>This method references a constant from the controller. This was the only place where the constant was used, so we can move it to our new class:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="co"># app/models/survey_inviter.rb</span>
<span class="dt">EMAIL_REGEX</span> = <span class="ot">/\A([^@\s]+)@((?:[-a-z0-9]+\.)+[a-z]{2,})\z/</span></code></pre>
<p>We can remove an instance variable in the controller by invoking this method directly in the view:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode rhtml"><code class="sourceCode rhtml"># app/views/invitations/new.html.erb
<span class="kw">&lt;%</span> <span class="kw">if</span> <span class="ot">@survey_inviter</span>.invalid_recipients <span class="kw">%&gt;</span>
  <span class="kw">&lt;div</span><span class="ot"> class=</span><span class="st">&quot;error&quot;</span><span class="kw">&gt;</span>
    Invalid email addresses: 
    <span class="kw">&lt;%=</span> <span class="ot">@survey_inviter</span>.invalid_recipients.join(<span class="st">', '</span>) <span class="kw">%&gt;</span>
  <span class="kw">&lt;/div&gt;</span>
<span class="kw">&lt;%</span> <span class="kw">end</span> <span class="kw">%&gt;</span></code></pre>
<p>Now that parsing email lists is <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/ruby-science/commit/0fefb969">moved out of our controller</a>, let's extract and delegate the only method in the controller that depends on <code>invalid_recipients</code>:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="co"># app/models/survey_inviter.rb</span>
<span class="kw">def</span> valid_recipients?
  invalid_recipients.empty?
<span class="kw">end</span></code></pre>
<p>Now we can remove <code>invalid_recipients</code> from the controller entirely.</p>
<p>The <code>valid_recipients?</code> method is only used in the compound validation condition:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="co"># app/controllers/invitations_controller.rb</span>
<span class="kw">if</span> valid_recipients? &amp;&amp; valid_message?</code></pre>
<p>If we extract <code>valid_message?</code> as well, we can fully encapsulate validation within <code>SurveyInviter</code>.</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="co"># app/models/survey_inviter.rb</span>
<span class="kw">def</span> valid_message?
  <span class="ot">@message</span>.present?
<span class="kw">end</span></code></pre>
<p>We need <code>message</code> for this method, so we'll add that to <code>initialize</code>:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="co"># app/models/survey_inviter.rb</span>
<span class="kw">def</span> initialize(message, recipients)
  <span class="ot">@message</span> = message
  <span class="ot">@recipients</span> = recipients
<span class="kw">end</span></code></pre>
<p>And pass it in:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="co"># app/controllers/invitations_controller.rb</span>
<span class="ot">@survey_inviter</span> = <span class="dt">SurveyInviter</span>.new(message, recipients)</code></pre>
<p>We can now extract a method to encapsulate this compound condition:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="co"># app/models/survey_inviter.rb</span>
<span class="kw">def</span> valid?
  valid_message? &amp;&amp; valid_recipients?
<span class="kw">end</span></code></pre>
<p>And use that new method in our controller:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="co"># app/controllers/invitations_controller.rb</span>
<span class="kw">if</span> <span class="ot">@survey_inviter</span>.valid?</code></pre>
<p>Now these methods can be private, trimming down the public interface for <code>SurveyInviter</code>:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="co"># app/models/survey_inviter.rb</span>
<span class="kw">private</span>

<span class="kw">def</span> valid_message?
  <span class="ot">@message</span>.present?
<span class="kw">end</span>

<span class="kw">def</span> valid_recipients?
  invalid_recipients.empty?
<span class="kw">end</span></code></pre>
<p>We've <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/ruby-science/commit/b434954d">pulled out most of the private methods</a>, so the remaining complexity results largely from saving and delivering the invitations.</p>
<p>Let's extract and move a <code>deliver</code> method for that:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="co"># app/models/survey_inviter.rb</span>
<span class="kw">def</span> deliver
  recipient_list.each <span class="kw">do</span> |email|
    invitation = <span class="dt">Invitation</span>.create(
      survey: <span class="ot">@survey</span>,
      sender: <span class="ot">@sender</span>,
      recipient_email: email,
      status: <span class="st">'pending'</span>
    )
    <span class="dt">Mailer</span>.invitation_notification(invitation, <span class="ot">@message</span>)
  <span class="kw">end</span>
<span class="kw">end</span></code></pre>
<p>We need the sender (the currently signed-in user) as well as the survey from the controller to do this. This pushes our initialize method up to four parameters, so let's switch to a hash:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="co"># app/models/survey_inviter.rb</span>
<span class="kw">def</span> initialize(attributes = {})
  <span class="ot">@survey</span> = attributes[<span class="st">:survey</span>]
  <span class="ot">@message</span> = attributes[<span class="st">:message</span>] || <span class="st">''</span>
  <span class="ot">@recipients</span> = attributes[<span class="st">:recipients</span>] || <span class="st">''</span>
  <span class="ot">@sender</span> = attributes[<span class="st">:sender</span>]
<span class="kw">end</span></code></pre>
<p>And extract a method in our controller to build it:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="co"># app/controllers/invitations_controller.rb</span>
<span class="kw">def</span> survey_inviter_attributes
  params[<span class="st">:invitation</span>].merge(survey: <span class="ot">@survey</span>, sender: current_user)
<span class="kw">end</span></code></pre>
<p>Now we can invoke this method in our controller:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="co"># app/controllers/invitations_controller.rb</span>
<span class="kw">if</span> <span class="ot">@survey_inviter</span>.valid?
  <span class="ot">@survey_inviter</span>.deliver
  redirect_to survey_path(<span class="ot">@survey</span>), notice: <span class="st">'Invitation successfully sent'</span>
<span class="kw">else</span>
  <span class="ot">@recipients</span> = recipients
  <span class="ot">@message</span> = message
  render <span class="st">'new'</span>
<span class="kw">end</span></code></pre>
<p>The <code>recipient_list</code> method is now only used internally in <code>SurveyInviter</code>, so let's make it private.</p>
<p>We've <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/ruby-science/commit/000babe1">moved most of the behavior out of the controller</a>, but we're still assigning a number of instance variables for the view, which have corresponding private methods in the controller. These values are also available on <code>SurveyInviter</code>, which is already assigned to the view, so let's expose those using <code>attr_reader</code>:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="co"># app/models/survey_inviter.rb</span>
<span class="ot">attr_reader</span> <span class="st">:message</span>, <span class="st">:recipients</span>, <span class="st">:survey</span></code></pre>
<p>And use them directly from the view:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode rhtml"><code class="sourceCode rhtml"># app/views/invitations/new.html.erb
<span class="kw">&lt;%=</span> simple_form_for(
  <span class="st">:invitation</span>,
  url: survey_invitations_path(<span class="ot">@survey_inviter</span>.survey)
) <span class="kw">do</span> <span class="ch">|</span>f<span class="ch">|</span> <span class="kw">%&gt;</span>
  <span class="kw">&lt;%=</span> f.input(
    <span class="st">:message</span>,
    as: <span class="st">:text</span>,
    input_html: <span class="ch">{</span> value: <span class="ot">@survey_inviter</span>.message <span class="ch">}</span>
  ) <span class="kw">%&gt;</span>
  <span class="kw">&lt;%</span> <span class="kw">if</span> <span class="ot">@invalid_message</span> <span class="kw">%&gt;</span>
    <span class="kw">&lt;div</span><span class="ot"> class=</span><span class="st">&quot;error&quot;</span><span class="kw">&gt;</span>Please provide a message<span class="kw">&lt;/div&gt;</span>
  <span class="kw">&lt;%</span> <span class="kw">end</span> <span class="kw">%&gt;</span>
  <span class="kw">&lt;%=</span> f.input(
    <span class="st">:recipients</span>,
    as: <span class="st">:text</span>,
    input_html: <span class="ch">{</span> value: <span class="ot">@survey_inviter</span>.recipients <span class="ch">}</span>
  ) <span class="kw">%&gt;</span></code></pre>
<p>Only the <code>SurveyInviter</code> is used in the controller now, so we can <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/ruby-science/commit/a0505921">remove the remaining instance variables and private methods</a>.</p>
<p>Our controller is now much simpler:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="co"># app/controllers/invitations_controller.rb</span>
<span class="kw">class</span> <span class="dt">InvitationsController</span> &lt; <span class="dt">ApplicationController</span>
  <span class="kw">def</span> new
    <span class="ot">@survey_inviter</span> = <span class="dt">SurveyInviter</span>.new(survey: survey)
  <span class="kw">end</span>

  <span class="kw">def</span> create
    <span class="ot">@survey_inviter</span> = <span class="dt">SurveyInviter</span>.new(survey_inviter_attributes)
    <span class="kw">if</span> <span class="ot">@survey_inviter</span>.valid?
      <span class="ot">@survey_inviter</span>.deliver
      redirect_to survey_path(survey), notice: <span class="st">'Invitation successfully sent'</span>
    <span class="kw">else</span>
      render <span class="st">'new'</span>
    <span class="kw">end</span>
  <span class="kw">end</span>

  <span class="kw">private</span>

  <span class="kw">def</span> survey_inviter_attributes
    params[<span class="st">:invitation</span>].merge(survey: survey, sender: current_user)
  <span class="kw">end</span>

  <span class="kw">def</span> survey
    <span class="dt">Survey</span>.find(params[<span class="st">:survey_id</span>])
  <span class="kw">end</span>
<span class="kw">end</span></code></pre>
<p>It only assigns one instance variable, it doesn't have too many methods and all of its methods are fairly small.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The newly extracted <code>SurveyInviter</code> class absorbed much of the complexity, but still isn't as bad as the original controller:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="co"># app/models/survey_inviter.rb</span>
<span class="kw">class</span> <span class="dt">SurveyInviter</span>
  <span class="dt">EMAIL_REGEX</span> = <span class="ot">/\A([^@\s]+)@((?:[-a-z0-9]+\.)+[a-z]{2,})\z/</span>

  <span class="kw">end</span>
<span class="kw">end</span></code></pre>

<h3><a href="#drawbacks-2">Drawbacks</a></h3>
<p>Extracting classes decreases the amount of complexity in each class, but increases the overall complexity of the application. Extracting too many classes will create a maze of indirection that developers will be unable to navigate.</p>
<p>Every class also requires a name. Introducing new names can help to explain functionality at a higher level and facilitate communication between developers. However, introducing too many names results in vocabulary overload, which makes the system difficult to learn for new developers.</p>
<p>If you extract classes in response to pain and resistance, you'll end up with just the right number of classes and names.</p>

<h3><a href="#example-19">Example</a></h3>
<p>In our example application, users can view a summary of the answers to each question on a survey. By default, in order to prevent the summary from influencing a user's own answers, users don't see summaries for questions they haven't answered yet. Users can click a link to override this decision and view the summary for every question. This concern is mixed across several levels, and introducing the change affects several classes. Let's see if we can refactor our application to make similar changes easier in the future.</p>
<p>Currently, the controller determines whether or not unanswered questions should display summaries:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="co"># app/controllers/summaries_controller.rb</span>
<span class="kw">def</span> constraints
  <span class="kw">if</span> include_unanswered?
    {}
  <span class="kw">else</span>
    { answered_by: current_user }
  <span class="kw">end</span>
<span class="kw">end</span>

<span class="kw">def</span> include_unanswered?
  params[<span class="st">:unanswered</span>]
<span class="kw">end</span></code></pre>
<p>It passes this decision into <code>Survey#summaries_using</code> as a hash containing Boolean flag:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="co"># app/controllers/summaries_controller.rb</span>
<span class="ot">@summaries</span> = <span class="ot">@survey</span>.summaries_using(summarizer, constraints)</code></pre>
<p></p>
<p><code>Survey#summaries_using</code> uses this information to decide whether each question should return a real summary or a hidden summary:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="co"># app/models/survey.rb</span>
<span class="kw">def</span> summaries_using(summarizer, options = {})
  questions.map <span class="kw">do</span> |question|
    <span class="kw">if</span> !options[<span class="st">:answered_by</span>] || question.answered_by?(options[<span class="st">:answered_by</span>])
      question.summary_using(summarizer)
    <span class="kw">else</span>
      <span class="dt">Summary</span>.new(question.title, <span class="dt">NO_ANSWER</span>)
    <span class="kw">end</span>
  <span class="kw">end</span>
<span class="kw">end</span></code></pre>
<p>This method is pretty dense. We can start by using <a href="#extract-method">extract method</a> to clarify and reveal complexity:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="co"># app/models/survey.rb</span>
<span class="kw">def</span> summaries_using(summarizer, options = {})
  questions.map <span class="kw">do</span> |question|
    summary_or_hidden_answer(summarizer, question, options[<span class="st">:answered_by</span>])
  <span class="kw">end</span>
<span class="kw">end</span>

<span class="kw">private</span>

<span class="kw">def</span> summary_or_hidden_answer(summarizer, question, answered_by)
  <span class="kw">if</span> hide_unanswered_question?(question, answered_by)
    hide_answer_to_question(question)
  <span class="kw">else</span>
    question.summary_using(summarizer)
  <span class="kw">end</span>
<span class="kw">end</span>

<span class="kw">def</span> hide_unanswered_question?(question, answered_by)
  answered_by &amp;&amp; !question.answered_by?(answered_by)
<span class="kw">end</span>

<span class="kw">def</span> hide_answer_to_question(question)
  <span class="dt">Summary</span>.new(question.title, <span class="dt">NO_ANSWER</span>)
<span class="kw">end</span></code></pre>
<p>The <code>summary_or_hidden_answer</code> method reveals a pattern that's well-captured by using a Decorator:</p>
<ul>
<li>There's a base case: returning the real summary for the question's answers.</li>
<li>There's an alternative, or decorated, case: returning a summary with a hidden answer.</li>
<li>The conditional logic for using the base or decorated case is unrelated to the base case: <code>answered_by</code> is only used for determining which path to take, and isn't used by to generate summaries.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a Rails developer, this may seem familiar to you: Many pieces of Rack middleware follow a similar approach.</p>
<p>Now that we've recognized this pattern, let's refactor to use a decorator.</p>
<section id="move-decorated-case-to-decorator" class="level4">
<h4><a href="#move-decorated-case-to-decorator">Move Decorated Case to Decorator</a></h4>
<p>Let's start by creating an empty class for the decorator and <a href="#move-method">moving one method</a> into it:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="co"># app/models/unanswered_question_hider.rb</span>
<span class="kw">class</span> <span class="dt">UnansweredQuestionHider</span>
  <span class="dt">NO_ANSWER</span> = <span class="st">&quot;You haven't answered this question&quot;</span>.freeze

  <span class="kw">def</span> hide_answer_to_question(question)
    <span class="dt">Summary</span>.new(question.title, <span class="dt">NO_ANSWER</span>)
  <span class="kw">end</span>
<span class="kw">end</span></code></pre>
<p>The method references a constant from <code>Survey</code>, so we moved that, too.</p>
<p>Now we update <code>Survey</code> to compose our new class:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="co"># app/models/survey.rb</span>
<span class="kw">def</span> summary_or_hidden_answer(summarizer, question, answered_by)
  <span class="kw">if</span> hide_unanswered_question?(question, answered_by)
    <span class="dt">UnansweredQuestionHider</span>.new.hide_answer_to_question(question)
  <span class="kw">else</span>
    question.summary_using(summarizer)
  <span class="kw">end</span>
<span class="kw">end</span></code></pre>
<p>At this point, the <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/ruby-science/commit/af2e8318">decorated path is contained within the decorator</a>.</p>
</section>
<section id="move-conditional-logic-into-decorator" class="level4">
<h4><a href="#move-conditional-logic-into-decorator">Move Conditional Logic Into Decorator</a></h4>
<p>Next, we can move the conditional logic into the decorator. We've already extracted this to its own method on <code>Survey</code>, so we can simply move this method over:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="co"># app/models/unanswered_question_hider.rb</span>
<span class="kw">def</span> hide_unanswered_question?(question, user)
  user &amp;&amp; !question.answered_by?(user)
<span class="kw">end</span></code></pre>
<p>Note that the <code>answered_by</code> parameter was renamed to <code>user</code>. That's because the context is more specific now, so it's clear what role the user is playing.</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="co"># app/models/survey.rb</span>
<span class="kw">def</span> summary_or_hidden_answer(summarizer, question, answered_by)
  hider = <span class="dt">UnansweredQuestionHider</span>.new
  <span class="kw">if</span> hider.hide_unanswered_question?(question, answered_by)
    hider.hide_answer_to_question(question)
  <span class="kw">else</span>
    question.summary_using(summarizer)
  <span class="kw">end</span>
<span class="kw">end</span></code></pre>
</section>
<section id="move-body-into-decorator" class="level4">
<h4><a href="#move-body-into-decorator">Move Body Into Decorator</a></h4>
<p><a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/ruby-science/commit/9d0274f4">There's just one summary-related method left in <code>Survey</code></a>: <code>summary_or_hidden_answer</code>. Let's move this into the decorator:</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/ruby-science/commit/4fd00a88">At this point</a>, every other method in the decorator can be made private.</p>
<p></p>
</section>
<section id="promote-parameters-to-instance-variables" class="level4">
<h4><a href="#promote-parameters-to-instance-variables">Promote Parameters to Instance Variables</a></h4>
<p>Now that we have a class to handle this logic, we can move some of the parameters into instance state. In <code>Survey#summaries_using</code>, we use the same summarizer and user instance; only the question varies as we iterate through questions to summarize. Let's move everything but the question into instance variables on the decorator:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="co"># app/models/unanswered_question_hider.rb</span>
<span class="kw">def</span> initialize(summarizer, user)
  <span class="ot">@summarizer</span> = summarizer

  questions.map <span class="kw">do</span> |question|
    <span class="dt">UnansweredQuestionHider</span>.new(summarizer, options[<span class="st">:answered_by</span>]).
      summary_or_hidden_answer(question)
  <span class="kw">end</span>
<span class="kw">end</span></code></pre>
<p><a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/ruby-science/commit/72801b57">Our decorator now just needs a <code>question</code> to generate a <code>Summary</code></a>.</p>
</section>
<section id="change-decorator-to-follow-component-interface" class="level4">
<h4><a href="#change-decorator-to-follow-component-interface">Change Decorator to Follow Component Interface</a></h4>
<p>In the end, the component we want to wrap with our decorator is the summarizer, so we want the decorator to obey the same interface as its component—the summarizer. Let's rename our only public method so that it follows the summarizer interface:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="co"># app/models/unanswered_question_hider.rb</span>
<span class="kw">def</span> summarize(question)</code></pre>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="co"># app/models/survey.rb</span>
<span class="dt">UnansweredQuestionHider</span>.new(summarizer, options[<span class="st">:answered_by</span>]).
  summarize(question)</code></pre>
<p><a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/ruby-science/commit/61ca6784">Our decorator now follows the component interface in name</a>—but not behavior. In our application, summarizers return a string that represents the answers to a question, but our decorator is returning a <code>Summary</code> instead. Let's fix our decorator to follow the component interface by returning just a string:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="co"># app/models/unanswered_question_hider.rb</span>
<span class="kw">def</span> summarize(question)
  <span class="kw">if</span> hide_unanswered_question?(question)
    hide_answer_to_question(question)
  <span class="kw">else</span>
    <span class="ot">@summarizer</span>.summarize(question)
  <span class="kw">end</span>
<span class="kw">end</span></code></pre>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="co"># app/models/unanswered_question_hider.rb</span>
<span class="kw">def</span> hide_answer_to_question(question)
  <span class="dt">NO_ANSWER</span>
<span class="kw">end</span></code></pre>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="co"># app/models/survey.rb</span>
<span class="kw">def</span> summaries_using(summarizer, options = {})
  questions.map <span class="kw">do</span> |question|
    hider = <span class="dt">UnansweredQuestionHider</span>.new(summarizer, options[<span class="st">:answered_by</span>])
    question.summary_using(hider)
  <span class="kw">end</span>
<span class="kw">end</span></code></pre>
<p>Our decorator now <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/ruby-science/commit/876ec976">follows the component interface</a>.</p>
<p>That last method on the decorator (<code>hide_answer_to_question</code>) isn't pulling its weight anymore: It just returns the value from a constant. Let's <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/ruby-science/commit/77b22c5a">inline it</a> to slim down our class a bit:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="co"># app/models/unanswered_question_hider.rb</span>
<span class="kw">def</span> summarize(question)
  <span class="kw">if</span> hide_unanswered_question?(question)
    <span class="dt">NO_ANSWER</span>
  <span class="kw">else</span>
    <span class="ot">@summarizer</span>.summarize(question)
  <span class="kw">end</span>
<span class="kw">end</span></code></pre>
<p>Now we have a decorator that can wrap any summarizer, nicely-factored and ready to use.</p>
</section>
<section id="invert-control" class="level4">
<h4><a href="#invert-control">Invert Control</a></h4>
<p>Now comes one of the most important steps: We can <a href="#dependency-inversion-principle">invert control</a> by removing any reference to the decorator from <code>Survey</code> and passing in an already-decorated summarizer.</p>
<p>The <code>summaries_using</code> method is simplified:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="co"># app/models/survey.rb</span>
<span class="kw">def</span> summaries_using(summarizer)
  questions.map <span class="kw">do</span> |question|
    question.summary_using(summarizer)
  <span class="kw">end</span>
<span class="kw">end</span></code></pre>
<p>Instead of passing the Boolean flag down from the controller, we can <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/ruby-science/commit/256a9c92">make the decision to decorate there</a> and pass a decorated or undecorated summarizer:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="co"># app/controllers/summaries_controller.rb</span>
<span class="kw">def</span> show
  <span class="ot">@survey</span> = <span class="dt">Survey</span>.find(params[<span class="st">:survey_id</span>])
  <span class="ot">@summaries</span> = <span class="ot">@survey</span>.summaries_using(decorated_summarizer)
<span class="kw">end</span>

<span class="kw">private</span>

<span class="kw">def</span> decorated_summarizer
  <span class="kw">if</span> include_unanswered?
    summarizer
  <span class="kw">else</span>
    <span class="dt">UnansweredQuestionHider</span>.new(summarizer, current_user)
  <span class="kw">end</span>
<span class="kw">end</span></code></pre>
<p>This isolates the decision to one class and keeps the result of the decision close to the class that makes it.</p>
<p>Another important effect of this refactoring is that the <code>Survey</code> class is now reverted back to <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/ruby-science/blob/d97f7856/example_app/app/models/survey.rb">the way it was before we started hiding unanswered question summaries</a>. This means that we can now add similar changes without modifying <code>Survey</code> at all.</p>

<section id="drawbacks-3" class="level3">
<h3><a href="#drawbacks-3">Drawbacks</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Decorators must keep up to date with their component interface. Our decorator follows the summarizer interface. Every decorator we add for this interface is one more class that will need to change any time we change the interface.</li>
<li>We removed a concern from <code>Survey</code> by hiding it behind a decorator, but this may make it harder for a developer to understand how a <code>Survey</code> might return the hidden response text, since that text doesn't appear anywhere in that class.</li>
<li>The component we decorated had the smallest possible interface: one public method. Classes with more public methods are more difficult to decorate.</li>
<li>Decorators can modify methods in the component interface easily, but adding new methods won't work with multiple decorators without meta-programming like <code>method_missing</code>. These constructs are harder to follow and should be used with care.</li>

<span class="kw">class</span> <span class="dt">EmailValidator</span> &lt; <span class="dt">ActiveModel</span>::<span class="dt">EachValidator</span>
  <span class="dt">EMAIL_REGEX</span> = <span class="ot">/\A([^@\s]+)@((?:[-a-z0-9]+\.)+[a-z]{2,})\z/i</span>
  <span class="kw">def</span> validate_each(record, attribute, value)
    <span class="kw">unless</span> value.match <span class="dt">EMAIL_REGEX</span>
      record.errors.add(attribute, <span class="st">&quot;</span><span class="ot">#{</span>value<span class="ot">}</span><span class="st"> is not a valid email&quot;</span>)
    <span class="kw">end</span>
  <span class="kw">end</span>
<span class="kw">end</span></code></pre>
<p>Once the validator has been extracted, Rails has a convention for using the new validation class. <code>EmailValidator</code> is used by setting <code>email: true</code> in the validation arguments:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="co"># app/models/invitation.rb</span>
<span class="kw">class</span> <span class="dt">Invitation</span> &lt; <span class="dt">ActiveRecord</span>::<span class="dt">Base</span>
  validates <span class="st">:recipient_email</span>, presence: <span class="dv">true</span>, email: <span class="dv">true</span>
<span class="kw">end</span></code></pre>
<p>The convention is to use the validation class name (in lower case, and removing <code>Validator</code> from the name). For example, if we were validating an attribute with <code>ZipCodeValidator</code>, we'd set <code>zip_code: true</code> as an argument to the validation call.</p>
<p>When validating an array of data as we do in <code>SurveyInviter</code>, we use the <code>EnumerableValidator</code> to loop over the contents of an array.</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="co"># app/models/survey_inviter.rb</span>
validates_with <span class="dt">EnumerableValidator</span>,
  attributes: [<span class="st">:recipients</span>],
  <span class="kw">unless</span>: <span class="st">'recipients.nil?'</span>,
  validator: <span class="dt">EmailValidator</span></code></pre>
<p></p>
<p>The <code>EmailValidator</code> is passed in as an argument, and each element in the array is validated against it.</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="co"># app/validators/enumerable_validator.rb</span>
<span class="kw">class</span> <span class="dt">EnumerableValidator</span> &lt; <span class="dt">ActiveModel</span>::<span class="dt">EachValidator</span>

<h3><a href="#example-22">Example</a></h3>
<p>This line of code was deemed hard enough to understand that adding a comment was necessary:</p>

<p>Adding an explaining variable makes the line easy to understand without requiring a comment:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="co"># app/models/open_question.rb</span>
<span class="kw">def</span> summary
  text_from_ordered_answers = answers.order(<span class="st">:created_at</span>).pluck(<span class="st">:text</span>)
  text_from_ordered_answers.join(<span class="st">', '</span>)
<span class="kw">end</span></code></pre>

<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="kw">def</span> summary

<span class="kw">private</span>

<span class="kw">def</span> text_from_ordered_answers
  answers.order(<span class="st">:created_at</span>).pluck(<span class="st">:text</span>)
<span class="kw">end</span></code></pre>
<p>This increases the overall size of the class and moves <code>text_from_ordered_answers</code> further away from <code>summary</code>, so you'll want to be careful when doing this. The most obvious reason to extract a method is to reuse the value of the variable.</p>
<p>However, there's another potential benefit: It changes the way developers read the code. Developers instinctively read code from the top down. Expressions based on variables place the details first, which means that developers will start with the details:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby">text_from_ordered_answers = answers.order(<span class="st">:created_at</span>).pluck(<span class="st">:text</span>)</code></pre>
<p>And work their way down to the overall goal of a method:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby">text_from_ordered_answers.join(<span class="st">', '</span>)</code></pre>
<p>Note that you naturally focus first on the code necessary to find the array of texts and then progress to see what happens to those texts.</p>
<p>Once a method is extracted, the high-level concept comes first:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="kw">def</span> summary
  text_from_ordered_answers.join(<span class="st">', '</span>)
<span class="kw">end</span></code></pre>
<p>And then you progress to the details:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="kw">def</span> text_from_ordered_answers
  answers.order(<span class="st">:created_at</span>).pluck(<span class="st">:text</span>)
<span class="kw">end</span></code></pre>
<p>You can use this technique of extracting methods to ensure that developers focus on what's important first and only dive into the implementation details when necessary.</p>

<p>However, this means we need to provide an abstract factory for each summarizer strategy:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="kw">class</span> <span class="dt">BreakdownFactory</span>
  <span class="kw">def</span> build
    <span class="dt">Breakdown</span>.new
  <span class="kw">end</span>
<span class="kw">end</span>

<span class="kw">class</span> <span class="dt">MostRecentFactory</span>
  <span class="kw">def</span> build
    <span class="dt">MostRecent</span>.new
  <span class="kw">end</span>
<span class="kw">end</span></code></pre>
<p></p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="kw">class</span> <span class="dt">UserAnswerFactory</span>
  <span class="kw">def</span> initialize(user)
    <span class="ot">@user</span> = user
  <span class="kw">end</span>

  <span class="kw">def</span> build
    <span class="dt">UserAnswer</span>.new(<span class="ot">@user</span>)
  <span class="kw">end</span>
<span class="kw">end</span></code></pre>
<p>These factory classes are repetitive and don't pull their weight. We can rip two of these classes out by using the actual summarizer class as the factory instance. First, let's rename the <code>build</code> method to <code>new</code>, to follow the Ruby convention:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="kw">def</span> summarizer
  summarizer_factory.new
<span class="kw">end</span>

<span class="kw">class</span> <span class="dt">BreakdownFactory</span>
  <span class="kw">def</span> new
    <span class="dt">Breakdown</span>.new
  <span class="kw">end</span>
<span class="kw">end</span>

<span class="kw">class</span> <span class="dt">MostRecentFactory</span>
  <span class="kw">def</span> new
    <span class="dt">MostRecent</span>.new
  <span class="kw">end</span>
<span class="kw">end</span></code></pre>
<p></p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="kw">class</span> <span class="dt">UserAnswerFactory</span>
  <span class="kw">def</span> initialize(user)
    <span class="ot">@user</span> = user
  <span class="kw">end</span>

  <span class="kw">def</span> new
    <span class="dt">UserAnswer</span>.new(<span class="ot">@user</span>)
  <span class="kw">end</span>
<span class="kw">end</span></code></pre>
<p>Now, an instance of <code>BreakdownFactory</code> acts exactly like the <code>Breakdown</code> class itself, and the same is true of <code>MostRecentFactory</code> and <code>MostRecent</code>. Therefore, let's use the classes themselves instead of instances of the factory classes:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="kw">def</span> summarizer_factory
  <span class="kw">case</span> params[<span class="st">:id</span>]
  <span class="kw">when</span> <span class="st">'breakdown'</span>
    <span class="dt">Breakdown</span>
  <span class="kw">when</span> <span class="st">'most_recent'</span>
    <span class="dt">MostRecent</span>
  <span class="kw">when</span> <span class="st">'your_answers'</span>
    <span class="dt">UserAnswerFactory</span>.new(current_user)
  <span class="kw">else</span>
    raise <span class="st">&quot;Unknown summary type: </span><span class="ot">#{</span>params[<span class="st">:id</span>]<span class="ot">}</span><span class="st">&quot;</span>
  <span class="kw">end</span>
<span class="kw">end</span></code></pre>
<p>Now we can delete two of our factory classes.</p>

<h1><a href="#move-method">Move Method</a></h1>
<p>Moving methods is generally easy. Moving a method allows you to place a method closer to the state it uses by moving it to the class that owns the related state.</p>
<p>To move a method:</p>
<ul>
<li>Move the entire method definition and body into the new class.</li>
<li>Change any parameters that are part of the state of the new class to simply reference the instance variables or methods.</li>
<li>Introduce any necessary parameters because of state which belongs to the old class.</li>
<li>Rename the method if the new name no longer makes sense in the new context (for example, rename <code>invite_user</code> to <code>invite</code> once the method is moved to the <code>User</code> class).</li>
<li>Replace calls to the old method to calls to the new method. This may require introducing delegation or building an instance of the new class.</li>

<li>Makes private, parameterized methods easier to reuse by moving them to public, unparameterized methods.</li>
<li>Improves readability by keeping methods close to the other methods they use.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's take a look at an example method that suffers from <a href="#feature-envy">feature envy</a> and use <a href="#extract-method">extract method</a> and <a href="#move-method">move method</a> to improve it:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="co"># app/models/completion.rb</span>
<span class="kw">def</span> score
  answers.inject(<span class="dv">0</span>) <span class="kw">do</span> |result, answer|
    question = answer.question
    result + question.score(answer.text)
  <span class="kw">end</span>
<span class="kw">end</span></code></pre>
<p>The block in this method suffers from <a href="#feature-envy">feature envy</a>: It references <code>answer</code> more than it references methods or instance variables from its own class. We can't move the entire method; we only want to move the block, so let's first extract a method:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="co"># app/models/completion.rb</span>
<span class="kw">def</span> score
  answers.inject(<span class="dv">0</span>) <span class="kw">do</span> |result, answer|
    result + score_for_answer(answer)
  <span class="kw">end</span>
<span class="kw">end</span></code></pre>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="co"># app/models/completion.rb</span>
<span class="kw">def</span> score_for_answer(answer)
  question = answer.question
  question.score(answer.text)
<span class="kw">end</span></code></pre>
<p>The <code>score</code> method no longer suffers from <a href="#feature-envy">feature envy</a>, and the new <code>score_for_answer</code> method is easy to move, because it only references its own state. See the <a href="#extract-method">Extract Method</a> chapter for details on the mechanics and properties of this refactoring.</p>
<p>Now that the <a href="#feature-envy">feature envy</a> is isolated, let's resolve it by moving the method:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="co"># app/models/completion.rb</span>
<span class="kw">def</span> score
  answers.inject(<span class="dv">0</span>) <span class="kw">do</span> |result, answer|
    result + answer.score
  <span class="kw">end</span>
<span class="kw">end</span></code></pre>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="co"># app/models/answer.rb</span>
<span class="kw">def</span> score
  question.score(text)
<span class="kw">end</span></code></pre>
<p>The newly extracted and moved <code>Question#score</code> method no longer suffers from <a href="#feature-envy">feature envy</a>. It's easier to reuse, because the logic is freed from the internal block in <code>Completion#score</code>. It's also available to other classes because it's no longer a private method. Both methods are also easier to follow because the methods they invoke are close to the methods they depend on.</p>

<h3><a href="#dangerous-move-and-extract-at-the-same-time">Dangerous: Move and Extract at the Same Time</a></h3>
<p>It's tempting to do everything as one change: create a new method in <code>Answer</code>, move the code over from <code>Completion</code> and change <code>Completion#score</code> to call the new method. Although this frequently works without a hitch, with practice, you can perform the two, smaller refactorings just as quickly as the single, larger refactoring. By breaking the refactoring into two steps, you reduce the duration of &quot;down time&quot; for your code; that is, you reduce the amount of time during which something is broken. Improving code in smaller steps makes it easier to debug when something goes wrong and prevents you from writing more code than you need to. Because the code still works after each step, you can simply stop whenever you're happy with the results.</p>

<section id="example-26" class="level3">
<h3><a href="#example-26">Example</a></h3>
<p>In our example application, users can create surveys and invite other users to answer them. Users are invited by listing email addresses to invite.</p>
<p>Any email addresses that match up with existing users are sent using a private message that the user will see the next time he or she signs in. Invitations to unrecognized addresses are sent using email messages.</p>
<p>The <code>Invitation</code> model delegates to a different strategy class based on whether or not its recipient email is recognized as an existing user:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="co"># app/models/invitation.rb</span>
<span class="kw">def</span> deliver
  <span class="kw">if</span> recipient_user
    <span class="dt">MessageInviter</span>.new(<span class="dv">self</span>, recipient_user).deliver
  <span class="kw">else</span>
    <span class="dt">EmailInviter</span>.new(<span class="dv">self</span>).deliver
  <span class="kw">end</span>
<span class="kw">end</span></code></pre>
<p>We've decided that the private messaging feature isn't getting enough use, so we're going to remove it. This means that all invitations will now be delivered via email, so we can simplify <code>Invitation#deliver</code> to always use the same strategy:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="co"># app/models/invitation.rb</span>
<span class="kw">def</span> deliver
  <span class="dt">EmailInviter</span>.new(<span class="dv">self</span>).deliver
<span class="kw">end</span></code></pre>
<p>The <code>EmailInviter</code> class was useful as a strategy, but now that the strategy no longer varies, it doesn't bring much to the table:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="co"># app/models/email_inviter.rb</span>
<span class="kw">class</span> <span class="dt">EmailInviter</span>
  <span class="kw">def</span> initialize(invitation)
    <span class="ot">@invitation</span> = invitation
    <span class="ot">@body</span> = <span class="dt">InvitationMessage</span>.new(<span class="ot">@invitation</span>).body
  <span class="kw">end</span>

  <span class="kw">def</span> deliver
    <span class="dt">Mailer</span>.invitation_notification(<span class="ot">@invitation</span>, <span class="ot">@body</span>).deliver
  <span class="kw">end</span>
<span class="kw">end</span></code></pre>
<p>It doesn't handle any concerns that aren't already well-encapsulated by <code>InvitationMessage</code> and <code>Mailer</code>, and it's only used once (in <code>Invitation</code>). We can inline this class into <code>Invitation</code> and eliminate some complexity and indirection from our application.</p>
<p>First, <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/ruby-science/commit/dcc40d60">let's inline the <code>EmailInviter#deliver</code> method</a> (and its dependent variables from <code>EmailInviter#initialize</code>):</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="co"># app/models/invitation.rb</span>
<span class="kw">def</span> deliver
  body = <span class="dt">InvitationMessage</span>.new(<span class="dv">self</span>).body
  <span class="dt">Mailer</span>.invitation_notification(<span class="dv">self</span>, body).deliver
<span class="kw">end</span></code></pre>
<p>Next, we can <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/ruby-science/commit/bc863108">delete <code>EmailInviter</code> entirely</a>.</p>
<p>After inlining the class, it requires fewer jumps through methods, classes and files to understand how invitations are delivered. Additionally, the application is less complex, overall. Flog gives us a total complexity score of 424.7 after this refactoring, down slightly from 427.6. That isn't a huge gain, but this was an easy refactoring, and continually deleting or inlining unnecessary classes and methods will have broader long-term effects.</p>

<h3><a href="#example-27">Example</a></h3>
<p>In our example applications, users can view a summary of the answers to each question on a survey. Users can select from one of several different summary types to view. For example, they can see the most recent answer to each question, or they can see a percentage breakdown of the answers to a multiple choice question.</p>
<p>The controller passes in the name of the summarizer that the user selected:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="co"># app/controllers/summaries_controller.rb</span>
<span class="kw">def</span> show
  <span class="ot">@survey</span> = <span class="dt">Survey</span>.find(params[<span class="st">:survey_id</span>])
  <span class="ot">@summaries</span> = <span class="ot">@survey</span>.summaries_using(summarizer, options)
<span class="kw">end</span>

<span class="kw">private</span>

<span class="kw">def</span> summarizer
  params[<span class="st">:id</span>]
<span class="kw">end</span></code></pre>
<p><code>Survey#summaries_using</code> asks each of its questions for a summary using that summarizer and the given options:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="co"># app/models/survey.rb</span>
question.summary_using(summarizer, options)</code></pre>
<p><code>Question#summary_using</code> instantiates the requested summarizer with the requested options, then asks the summarizer to summarize the question:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="co"># app/models/question.rb</span>
<span class="kw">def</span> summary_using(summarizer_name, options)
  summarizer_factory = <span class="st">&quot;Summarizer::</span><span class="ot">#{</span>summarizer_name.classify<span class="ot">}</span><span class="st">&quot;</span>.constantize
  summarizer = summarizer_factory.new(options)
  value = summarizer.summarize(<span class="dv">self</span>)
  <span class="dt">Summary</span>.new(title, value)
<span class="kw">end</span></code></pre>
<p>This is hard to follow and causes <a href="#shotgun-surgery">shotgun surgery</a> because the logic of building the summarizer is in <code>Question</code>, far away from the choice of which summarizer to use, which is in <code>SummariesController</code>. Additionally, the <code>options</code> parameter needs to be passed down several levels so that summarizer-specific options can be provided when building the summarizer.</p>
<p>Let's remedy this by having the controller build the actual summarizer instance. First, we'll move that logic from <code>Question</code> to <code>SummariesController</code>:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="co"># app/controllers/summaries_controller.rb</span>
<span class="kw">def</span> show
  <span class="ot">@survey</span> = <span class="dt">Survey</span>.find(params[<span class="st">:survey_id</span>])
  <span class="ot">@summaries</span> = <span class="ot">@survey</span>.summaries_using(summarizer, options)
<span class="kw">end</span>

<span class="kw">private</span>

<span class="kw">def</span> summarizer
  summarizer_name = params[<span class="st">:id</span>]
  summarizer_factory = <span class="st">&quot;Summarizer::</span><span class="ot">#{</span>summarizer_name.classify<span class="ot">}</span><span class="st">&quot;</span>.constantize
  summarizer_factory.new(options)
<span class="kw">end</span></code></pre>
<p>Then, we'll change <code>Question#summary_using</code> to take an instance instead of a name:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="co"># app/models/question.rb</span>
<span class="kw">def</span> summary_using(summarizer, options)
  value = summarizer.summarize(<span class="dv">self</span>)
  <span class="dt">Summary</span>.new(title, value)
<span class="kw">end</span></code></pre>
<p>That <code>options</code> argument is no longer necessary because it was only used to build the summarizer—which is now handled by the controller. Let's remove it:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="co"># app/models/question.rb</span>
<span class="kw">def</span> summary_using(summarizer)
  value = summarizer.summarize(<span class="dv">self</span>)
  <span class="dt">Summary</span>.new(title, value)
<span class="kw">end</span></code></pre>
<p>We also don't need to pass it from <code>Survey</code>:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="co"># app/models/survey.rb</span>
question.summary_using(summarizer)</code></pre>
<p>This interaction has already improved, because the <code>options</code> argument is no longer uselessly passed around through two models. It's only used in the controller where the summarizer instance is built. Building the summarizer in the controller is appropriate, because the controller knows the name of the summarizer we want to build, as well as which options are used when building it.</p>
<p>Now that we're using dependency injection, we can take this even further.</p>
<p>By default, in order to prevent the summary from influencing a user's own answers, users don't see summaries for questions they haven't answered yet. Users can click a link to override this decision and view the summary for every question.</p>
<p>The information that determines whether or not to hide unanswered questions lives in the controller:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="co"># app/controllers/summaries_controller.rb</span>
<span class="kw">def</span> constraints
  <span class="kw">if</span> include_unanswered?
    {}
  <span class="kw">else</span>
    { answered_by: current_user }
  <span class="kw">end</span>
<span class="kw">end</span></code></pre>
<p>However, this information is passed into <code>Survey#summaries_using</code>:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="co"># app/controllers/summaries_controller.rb</span>
<span class="ot">@summaries</span> = <span class="ot">@survey</span>.summaries_using(summarizer, options)</code></pre>
<p><code>Survey#summaries_using</code> decides whether to hide the answer to each question based on that setting:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="co"># app/models/survey.rb</span>
  <span class="kw">def</span> summaries_using(summarizer, options = {})
    questions.map <span class="kw">do</span> |question|
      summary_or_hidden_answer(summarizer, question, options)
    <span class="kw">end</span>
  <span class="kw">end</span>

  <span class="kw">private</span>

  <span class="kw">def</span> summary_or_hidden_answer(summarizer, question, options)
    <span class="kw">if</span> hide_unanswered_question?(question, options[<span class="st">:answered_by</span>])
      hide_answer_to_question(question)
    <span class="kw">else</span>
      question.summary_using(summarizer)
    <span class="kw">end</span>
  <span class="kw">end</span>

  <span class="kw">def</span> hide_unanswered_question?(question, answered_by)
    answered_by &amp;&amp; !question.answered_by?(answered_by)
  <span class="kw">end</span>

  <span class="kw">def</span> hide_answer_to_question(question)
    <span class="dt">Summary</span>.new(question.title, <span class="dt">NO_ANSWER</span>)
  <span class="kw">end</span>
<span class="kw">end</span></code></pre>
<p>Again, the decision is far away from the dependent behavior.</p>
<p>We can combine our dependency injection with a <a href="#extract-decorator">decorator</a> to remove the duplicate decision:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="co"># app/models/unanswered_question_hider.rb</span>
<span class="kw">class</span> <span class="dt">UnansweredQuestionHider</span>
  <span class="dt">NO_ANSWER</span> = <span class="st">&quot;You haven't answered this question&quot;</span>.freeze

  <span class="kw">def</span> initialize(summarizer, user)
    <span class="ot">@summarizer</span> = summarizer
    <span class="ot">@user</span> = user
  <span class="kw">end</span>

  <span class="kw">def</span> summarize(question)
    <span class="kw">if</span> hide_unanswered_question?(question)
      <span class="dt">NO_ANSWER</span>
    <span class="kw">else</span>
      <span class="ot">@summarizer</span>.summarize(question)
    <span class="kw">end</span>
  <span class="kw">end</span>

  <span class="kw">private</span>

  <span class="kw">def</span> hide_unanswered_question?(question)
    !question.answered_by?(<span class="ot">@user</span>)
  <span class="kw">end</span>
<span class="kw">end</span></code></pre>
<p>We'll decide whether or not to decorate the base summarizer in our controller:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="co"># app/controllers/summaries_controller.rb</span>
<span class="kw">def</span> decorated_summarizer

<h3><a href="#drawbacks-5">Drawbacks</a></h3>
<p>Injecting dependencies in our example made each class—<code>SummariesController</code>, <code>Survey</code>, <code>Question</code> and <code>UnansweredQuestionHider</code>—easier to understand as a unit. However, it's now difficult to understand what kind of summaries will be produced just by looking at <code>Survey</code> or <code>Question</code>. You need to follow the stack up to <code>SummariesController</code> to understand the dependencies and then look at each class to understand how they're used.</p>
<p>In this case, we believe that using dependency injection resulted in an overall win for readability and flexibility. However, it's important to remember that the further you move a dependency's resolution from its use, the harder it is to figure out what's actually being used in lower level components.</p>
<p>In our example, there isn't an easy way to know which class will be instantiated for the <code>summarizer</code> parameter to <code>Question#summary_using</code>:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="co"># app/models/question.rb</span>
<span class="kw">def</span> summary_using(summarizer)
  value = summarizer.summarize(<span class="dv">self</span>)
  <span class="dt">Summary</span>.new(title, value)
<span class="kw">end</span></code></pre>
<p>In our case, that will be one of <code>Summarizer::Breakdown</code>, <code>Summarizer::MostRecent</code> or <code>Summarizer::UserAnswer</code>, or a <code>UnansweredQuestionHider</code> that decorates one of the above. Developers will need to trace back up through <code>Survey</code> to <code>SummariesController</code> to gather all the possible implementations.</p>

<p>Subclasses are a common method of achieving reuse and polymorphism, but inheritance has its drawbacks. See <a href="#composition-over-inheritance">composition over inheritance</a> for reasons why you might decide to avoid an inheritance-based model.</p>
<p>During this refactoring, we will replace the subclasses with individual strategy classes. Each strategy class will implement a common interface. The original base class is promoted from an abstract class to the composition root, which composes the strategy classes.</p>
<p>This allows for smaller interfaces, stricter separation of concerns and easier testing. It also makes it possible to swap out part of the structure, which, in an inheritance-based model, would require converting to a new type.</p>

<ul>
<li>You can't actually change the class of an instance in Ruby, so you need to return the instance of the new class.</li>
<li>The implementation requires deleting and creating records, but part of the transaction (<code>destroy</code>) must execute before we can validate the new instance. This results in control flow using exceptions.</li>
<li>It's hard to understand why this method is implemented the way it is, so other developers fixing bugs or refactoring in the future will have a hard time navigating it.</li>
</ul>
<p>We can make this operation easier by using composition instead of inheritance.</p>
<p>This is a difficult change that becomes larger as more behavior is added to the inheritance tree. We can make the change easier by breaking it down into smaller steps, ensuring that the application is in a fully functional state with passing tests after each change. This allows us to debug in smaller sessions and create safe checkpoint commits that we can retreat to if something goes wrong.</p>

<h4><a href="#use-extract-class-to-extract-non-railsy-methods-from-subclasses">Use Extract Class to Extract Non-Railsy Methods from Subclasses</a></h4>
<p>The easiest way to start is by extracting a strategy class from each subclass and moving (and delegating) as many methods as you can to the new class. There's some class-level wizardry that goes on in some Rails features, like associations, so let's start by moving simple, instance-level methods that aren't part of the framework.</p>
<p>Let's start with a simple subclass: <code>OpenQuestion.</code></p>
<p>Here's the <code>OpenQuestion</code> class using an STI model:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="co"># app/models/open_question.rb</span>
<span class="kw">class</span> <span class="dt">OpenQuestion</span> &lt; <span class="dt">Question</span>
  <span class="kw">def</span> score(text)
    <span class="dv">0</span>
  <span class="kw">end</span>

  <span class="kw">def</span> breakdown
    text_from_ordered_answers = answers.order(<span class="st">:created_at</span>).pluck(<span class="st">:text</span>)
    text_from_ordered_answers.join(<span class="st">', '</span>)
  <span class="kw">end</span>
<span class="kw">end</span></code></pre>
<p>We can start by creating a new strategy class:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="kw">class</span> <span class="dt">OpenSubmittable</span>
<span class="kw">end</span></code></pre>
<p>When switching from inheritance to composition, you need to add a new word to the application's vocabulary. Before, we had questions, and different subclasses of questions handled the variations in behavior and data. Now, we're switching to a model where there's only one question class, and the question will compose <em>something</em> that will handle the variations. In our case, that <em>something</em> is a &quot;submittable.&quot; In our new model, each question is just a question, and every question composes a submittable that decides how the question can be submitted. Thus, our first extracted class is called <code>OpenSubmittable,</code> extracted from <code>OpenQuestion.</code></p>
<p>Let's move our first method over to <code>OpenSubmittable</code>:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="co"># app/models/open_submittable.rb</span>
<span class="kw">class</span> <span class="dt">OpenSubmittable</span>
  <span class="kw">def</span> score(text)
    <span class="dv">0</span>
  <span class="kw">end</span>
<span class="kw">end</span></code></pre>
<p>And change <code>OpenQuestion</code> to delegate to it:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="co"># app/models/open_question.rb</span>
<span class="kw">class</span> <span class="dt">OpenQuestion</span> &lt; <span class="dt">Question</span>
  <span class="kw">def</span> score(text)
    submittable.score(text)
  <span class="kw">end</span>

  <span class="kw">def</span> breakdown
    text_from_ordered_answers = answers.order(<span class="st">:created_at</span>).pluck(<span class="st">:text</span>)
    text_from_ordered_answers.join(<span class="st">', '</span>)
  <span class="kw">end</span>

  <span class="kw">def</span> submittable
    <span class="dt">OpenSubmittable</span>.new
  <span class="kw">end</span>
<span class="kw">end</span></code></pre>
<p>Each question subclass implements the <code>score</code> method, so we repeat this process for <code>MultipleChoiceQuestion</code> and <code>ScaleQuestion</code>. You can see the full change for this step in the <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/ruby-science/commit/7747366a12b3f6f21d0008063c5655faba8e4890">example app</a>.</p>
<p>At this point, we've introduced a parallel inheritance hierarchy. During a longer refactor, things may get worse before they get better. This is one of several reasons that it's always best to refactor on a branch, separately from any feature work. We'll make sure that the parallel inheritance hierarchy is removed before merging.</p>

<h4><a href="#pull-up-delegate-method-into-base-class">Pull Up Delegate Method into Base Class</a></h4>
<p>After the first step, each subclass implements a <code>submittable</code> method to build its parallel strategy class. The <code>score</code> method in each subclass simply delegates to its submittable. We can now pull the <code>score</code> method up into the base <code>Question</code> class, completely removing this concern from the subclasses.</p>
<p>First, we add a delegator to <code>Question</code>:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="co"># app/models/question.rb</span>

<p>The most interesting part of this change is that the <code>breakdown</code> method requires state from the subclasses, so the question is now provided to the submittable:</p>

<h4><a href="#move-remaining-non-railsy-public-methods-into-strategies">Move Remaining Non-Railsy Public Methods into Strategies</a></h4>
<p>We can take a similar approach for the uncommon API; that is, public methods that are only implemented in one subclass.</p>
<p>First, move the body of the method into the strategy:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="co"># app/models/scale_submittable.rb</span>
<span class="kw">def</span> steps
  (<span class="ot">@question</span>.minimum..<span class="ot">@question</span>.maximum).to_a

<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="co"># app/models/scale_question.rb</span>
<span class="kw">def</span> steps
  submittable.steps
<span class="kw">end</span></code></pre>
<p>Repeat this step for the remaining public methods that aren't part of the Rails framework. You can see the full change for this step in our <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/ruby-science/commit/2bce7f7b0812b417dc41af369d18b83e057419ac">example app</a>.</p>
</section>
<section id="remove-delegators-from-subclasses" class="level4">
<h4><a href="#remove-delegators-from-subclasses">Remove Delegators from Subclasses</a></h4>
<p>Our subclasses now contain only delegators, code to instantiate the submittable, and framework code. Eventually, we want to completely delete these subclasses, so let's start stripping them down. The delegators are easiest to delete, so let's take them on before the framework code.</p>
<p>First, find where the delegators are used:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode rhtml"><code class="sourceCode rhtml"># app/views/multiple_choice_questions/_multiple_choice_question_form.html.erb
<span class="kw">&lt;%=</span> form.fields_for(<span class="st">:options</span>, question.options_for_form) <span class="kw">do</span> <span class="ch">|</span>option_fields<span class="ch">|</span> <span class="kw">-%&gt;</span>

<span class="kw">&lt;%</span> <span class="kw">end</span> <span class="kw">-%&gt;</span></code></pre>
<p>And change the code to directly use the strategy instead:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode rhtml"><code class="sourceCode rhtml"># app/views/multiple_choice_questions/_multiple_choice_question_form.html.erb
<span class="kw">&lt;%=</span> form.fields_for(<span class="st">:options</span>, submittable.options_for_form) <span class="kw">do</span> <span class="ch">|</span>option_fields<span class="ch">|</span> <span class="kw">-%&gt;</span>

<span class="kw">&lt;%</span> <span class="kw">end</span> <span class="kw">-%&gt;</span></code></pre>
<p>You may need to pass the strategy in where the subclass was used before:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode rhtml"><code class="sourceCode rhtml"># app/views/questions/_form.html.erb
<span class="kw">&lt;%=</span> render(
  <span class="st">&quot;</span><span class="ot">#{</span>question.to_partial_path<span class="ot">}</span><span class="st">_form&quot;</span>,
  submittable: question.submittable,
  form: form
) <span class="kw">%&gt;</span></code></pre>
<p>We can come back to these locations later and see if we need to pass in the question at all.</p>
<p>After fixing the code that uses the delegator, remove the delegator from the subclass. Repeat this process for each delegator until they've all been removed.</p>
<p>You can see how we do this in the <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/ruby-science/commit/c7a61dadfed53b9d93b578064d982f22d62f7b8d">example app</a>.</p>

<h4><a href="#instantiate-strategy-directly-from-base-class">Instantiate Strategy Directly from Base Class</a></h4>
<p>If you look carefully at the <code>submittable</code> method from each question subclass, you'll notice that it simply instantiates a class based on its own class name and passes itself to the <code>initialize</code> method:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="co"># app/models/open_question.rb</span>
<span class="kw">def</span> submittable

  submittable_class_name.constantize.new(<span class="dv">self</span>)
<span class="kw">end</span></code></pre>
<p>We can then delete <code>submittable</code> from each of the subclasses.</p>
<p>At this point, the subclasses contain only Rails-specific code, like associations and validations.</p>

<h4><a href="#a-fork-in-the-road">A Fork in the Road</a></h4>
<p>At this point, we're faced with a difficult decision. At first glance, it seems as though only associations and validations live in our subclasses, and we could easily move those to our strategy. However, there are two major issues.</p>
<p>First, you can't move the association to a strategy class without making that strategy an <code>ActiveRecord::Base</code> subclass. Associations are deeply coupled with <code>ActiveRecord::Base</code> and they simply won't work in other situations.</p>
<p>Also, one of our submittable strategies has state specific to that strategy. Scale questions have a minimum and maximum. These fields are only used by scale questions, but they're on the questions table. We can't remove this pollution without creating a table for scale questions.</p>
<p>There are two obvious ways to proceed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Continue without making the strategies <code>ActiveRecord::Base</code> subclasses. Keep the association for multiple choice questions and the minimum and maximum for scale questions on the <code>Question</code> class, and use that data from the strategy. This will result in <a href="#divergent-change">divergent change</a> and probably a <a href="#large-class">large class</a> on <code>Question</code>, as every change in the data required for new or existing strategies will require new behavior on <code>Question</code>.</li>
<li>Convert the strategies to <code>ActiveRecord::Base</code> subclasses. Move the association and state specific to strategies to those classes. This involves creating a table for each strategy and adding a polymorphic association to <code>Question.</code> This will avoid polluting the <code>Question</code> class with future strategy changes, but is awkward right now, because the tables for multiple choice questions and open questions would contain no data except the primary key. These tables provide a placeholder for future strategy-specific data, but those strategies may never require any more data and until they do, the tables are a waste of queries and the developer's mental space.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this example, we'll move forward with the second approach, because:</p>
<ul>
<li>It's easier with ActiveRecord. ActiveRecord will take care of instantiating the strategy in most situations if it's an association, and it has special behavior for associations using nested attribute forms.</li>
<li>It's the easiest way to avoid <a href="#divergent-change">divergent change</a> and <a href="#large-class">large classes</a> in a Rails application. Both of these smells can cause problems that are hard to fix if you wait too long.</li>
</ul>

<section id="convert-strategies-to-activerecord-subclasses" class="level4">
<h4><a href="#convert-strategies-to-activerecord-subclasses">Convert Strategies to ActiveRecord Subclasses</a></h4>
<p>Continuing with our refactor, we'll change each of our strategy classes to inherit from <code>ActiveRecord::Base</code>.</p>
<p>First, simply declare that the class is a child of <code>ActiveRecord::Base</code>:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="co"># app/models/open_submittable.rb</span>
<span class="kw">class</span> <span class="dt">OpenSubmittable</span> &lt; <span class="dt">ActiveRecord</span>::<span class="dt">Base</span></code></pre>

    <span class="kw">end</span>
  <span class="kw">end</span>
<span class="kw">end</span></code></pre>
<p>Our strategies currently accept the question as a parameter to <code>initialize</code> and assign it as an instance variable. In an <code>ActiveRecord::Base</code> subclass, we don't control <code>initialize</code>, so let's change <code>question</code> from an instance variable to an association and pass a hash:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="co"># app/models/open_submittable.rb</span>

<h4><a href="#introduce-a-polymorphic-association">Introduce a Polymorphic Association</a></h4>
<p>Now that our strategies are persistable using ActiveRecord, we can use them in a polymorphic association. Let's add the association:</p>

<span class="kw">end</span></code></pre>
<p>We're currently defining a <code>submittable</code> method that overrides the association. Let's change that to a method that will build the association based on the STI type:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="co"># app/models/question.rb</span>
<span class="kw">def</span> build_submittable

  <span class="dv">self</span>.submittable = submittable_class.new(question: <span class="dv">self</span>)
<span class="kw">end</span></code></pre>
<p>Previously, the <code>submittable</code> method built the submittable on demand, but now it's persisted in an association and built explicitly. Let's change our controllers accordingly:</p>

<h4><a href="#pass-attributes-to-strategies">Pass Attributes to Strategies</a></h4>
<p>We're persisting the strategy as an association, but the strategies currently don't have any state. We need to change that, since scale submittables need a minimum and maximum.</p>
<p>Let's change our <code>build_submittable</code> method to accept attributes:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="co"># app/models/question.rb</span>
<span class="kw">def</span> build_submittable(attributes)
  submittable_class = type.sub(<span class="st">'Question'</span>, <span class="st">'Submittable'</span>).constantize
  <span class="dv">self</span>.submittable = submittable_class.new(attributes.merge(question: <span class="dv">self</span>))
<span class="kw">end</span></code></pre>
<p>We can quickly change the invocations to pass an empty hash, and we're back to green.</p>
<p>Next, let's move the <code>minimum</code> and <code>maximum</code> fields over to the <code>scale_submittables</code> table:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="co"># db/migrate/20130131211856_move_scale_question_state_to_scale_submittable.rb</span>
add_column <span class="st">:scale_submittables</span>, <span class="st">:minimum</span>, <span class="st">:integer</span>
add_column <span class="st">:scale_submittables</span>, <span class="st">:maximum</span>, <span class="st">:integer</span></code></pre>
<p>Note that this migration is <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/ruby-science/blob/41b49f49706135572a1b907f6a4c9747fb8446bb/example_app/db/migrate/20130131211856_move_scale_question_state_to_scale_submittable.rb">rather lengthy</a>, because we also need to move over the minimum and maximum values for existing questions. The SQL in our example app will work on most databases, but is cumbersome. If you're using PostgreSQL, you can handle the <code>down</code> method easier using an <code>UPDATE FROM</code> statement.</p>
<p>Next, we'll move validations for these attributes over from <code>ScaleQuestion</code>:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="co"># app/models/scale_submittable.rb</span>
validates <span class="st">:maximum</span>, presence: <span class="dv">true</span>
validates <span class="st">:minimum</span>, presence: <span class="dv">true</span></code></pre>
<p>And change <code>ScaleSubmittable</code> methods to use those attributes directly, rather than looking for them on <code>question</code>:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="co"># app/models/scale_submittable.rb</span>
<span class="kw">def</span> steps
  (minimum..maximum).to_a
<span class="kw">end</span></code></pre>
<p>We can pass those attributes in our form by using <code>fields_for</code> and <code>accepts_nested_attributes_for</code>:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode rhtml"><code class="sourceCode rhtml"># app/views/scale_questions/_scale_question_form.html.erb
<span class="kw">&lt;%=</span> form.fields_for <span class="st">:submittable</span> <span class="kw">do</span> <span class="ch">|</span>submittable_fields<span class="ch">|</span> <span class="kw">-%&gt;</span>
  <span class="kw">&lt;%=</span> submittable_fields.input <span class="st">:minimum</span> <span class="kw">%&gt;</span>
  <span class="kw">&lt;%=</span> submittable_fields.input <span class="st">:maximum</span> <span class="kw">%&gt;</span>
<span class="kw">&lt;%</span> <span class="kw">end</span> <span class="kw">-%&gt;</span></code></pre>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="co"># app/models/question.rb</span>
accepts_nested_attributes_for <span class="st">:submittable</span></code></pre>
<p>In order to make sure the <code>Question</code> fails when its submittable is invalid, we can cascade the validation:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="co"># app/models/question.rb</span>
validates <span class="st">:submittable</span>, associated: <span class="dv">true</span></code></pre>
<p>Now, we just need our controllers to pass the appropriate submittable parameters:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="co"># app/controllers/questions_controller.rb</span>
<span class="kw">def</span> build_question
  <span class="ot">@question</span> = type.constantize.new(question_params)
  <span class="ot">@question</span>.build_submittable(submittable_params)
  <span class="ot">@question</span>.survey = <span class="ot">@survey</span>
<span class="kw">end</span></code></pre>
<p></p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="co"># app/controllers/questions_controller.rb</span>
<span class="kw">def</span> question_params
  params.
    require(<span class="st">:question</span>).
    permit(<span class="st">:title</span>, <span class="st">:options_attributes</span>)
<span class="kw">end</span>

<span class="kw">def</span> submittable_params
  <span class="kw">if</span> submittable_attributes = params[<span class="st">:question</span>][<span class="st">:submittable_attributes</span>]
    submittable_attributes.permit(<span class="st">:minimum</span>, <span class="st">:maximum</span>)
  <span class="kw">else</span>
    {}
  <span class="kw">end</span>
<span class="kw">end</span></code></pre>
<p>All behavior and state is now moved from <code>ScaleQuestion</code> to <code>ScaleSubmittable</code>, and the <code>ScaleQuestion</code> class is completely empty.</p>
<p>You can view the full change in the <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/ruby-science/commit/41b49f49706135572a1b907f6a4c9747fb8446bb">example app</a>.</p>

<h4><a href="#move-remaining-railsy-behavior-out-of-subclasses">Move Remaining Railsy Behavior Out of Subclasses</a></h4>
<p>We can now repeat this process for remaining Rails-specific behavior. In our case, this is the logic to handle the <code>options</code> association for multiple choice questions.</p>
<p>We can move the association and behavior over to the strategy class:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="co"># app/models/multiple_choice_submittable.rb</span>
has_many <span class="st">:options</span>, foreign_key: <span class="st">:question_id</span>
has_one <span class="st">:question</span>, as: <span class="st">:submittable</span>

accepts_nested_attributes_for <span class="st">:options</span>, reject_if: <span class="st">:all_blank</span></code></pre>
<p>Again, we remove the <code>options</code> method which delegated to <code>question</code> and rely on <code>options</code> being directly available. Then we update the form to use <code>fields_for</code> and move the allowed attributes in the controller from <code>question</code> to <code>submittable</code>.</p>
<p>At this point, every question subclass is completely empty.</p>

<h4><a href="#pass-the-type-when-instantiating-the-strategy">Pass the Type When Instantiating the Strategy</a></h4>
<p>At this point, the subclasses are just dead weight. However, we can't delete them just yet. We're relying on the <code>type</code> column to decide what type of strategy to build, and Rails will complain if we have a <code>type</code> column without corresponding subclasses.</p>
<p>Let's remove our dependence on that <code>type</code> column. Accept a <code>type</code> when building the submittable:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="co"># app/models/question.rb</span>
<span class="kw">def</span> build_submittable(type, attributes)

<section id="always-instantiate-the-base-class" class="level4">
<h4><a href="#always-instantiate-the-base-class">Always Instantiate the Base Class</a></h4>
<p>Now we can remove our dependence on the STI subclasses by always building an instance of <code>Question</code>.</p>
<p>In our controller, we change this line:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="co"># app/controllers/questions_controller.rb</span>
<span class="ot">@question</span> = type.constantize.new(question_params)</code></pre>

<span class="ot">@question</span> = <span class="dt">Question</span>.new(question_params)</code></pre>
<p>We're still relying on <code>type</code> as a parameter in forms and links to decide what type of submittable to build. Let's change that to <code>submittable_type</code>, which is already available because of our polymorphic association:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="co"># app/controllers/questions_controller.rb</span>
params[<span class="st">:question</span>][<span class="st">:submittable_type</span>]</code></pre>

<span class="kw">&lt;%=</span> form.hidden_field <span class="st">:submittable_type</span> <span class="kw">%&gt;</span></code></pre>
<p>We'll also need to revisit views that rely on <a href="#polymorphic-partials">polymorphic partials</a> based on the question type and change them to rely on the submittable type instead:</p>

  question.submittable,

<section id="remove-subclasses" class="level4">
<h4><a href="#remove-subclasses">Remove Subclasses</a></h4>
<p>Now for a quick, glorious change: those <code>Question</code> subclasses are entirely empty and unused, so we can <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/ruby-science/commit/c6f0e545ae9b3da017b3318f2882cb40954213ee">delete them</a>.</p>
<p>This also removes the parallel inheritance hierarchy that we introduced earlier.</p>
<p>At this point, the code is as good as we found it.</p>

<section id="simplify-type-switching" class="level4">
<h4><a href="#simplify-type-switching">Simplify Type Switching</a></h4>
<p>If you were previously switching from one subclass to another as we did to change question types, you can now greatly simplify that code.</p>
<p>Instead of deleting the old question and cloning it with a merged set of old generic attributes and new specific attributes, you can simply swap in a new strategy for the old one.</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="co"># app/models/question.rb</span>
<span class="kw">def</span> switch_to(type, attributes)
  old_submittable = submittable
  build_submittable type, attributes

  transaction <span class="kw">do</span>
    <span class="kw">if</span> save
      old_submittable.destroy
    <span class="kw">end</span>
  <span class="kw">end</span>
<span class="kw">end</span></code></pre>
<p>Our new <code>switch_to</code> method is greatly improved:</p>
<ul>
<li>This method no longer needs to return anything, because there's no need to clone. This is nice because <code>switch_to</code> is no longer a mixed command and query method (i.e., it does something and returns something), but simply a command method (i.e., it just does something).</li>
<li>The method no longer needs to delete the old question, and the new submittable is valid before we delete the old one. This means we no longer need to use exceptions for control flow.</li>
<li>It's simpler and its code is obvious, so other developers will have no trouble refactoring or fixing bugs.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can see the full change that resulted in our new method in the <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/ruby-science/commit/5f4a14ff6c43bf5b846d1c58d7509861c6fe3ac1">example app</a>.</p>
</section>
<section id="conclusion" class="level4">
<h4><a href="#conclusion">Conclusion</a></h4>
<p>Our new, composition-based model is improved in a number of ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>It's easy to change types.</li>
<li>Each submittable is easy to use independently of its question, reducing coupling.</li>
<li>There's a clear boundary in the API for questions and submittables, making it easier to test—and less likely that concerns leak between the two.</li>
<li>Shared behavior happens via composition, making it less likely that the base class will become a <a href="#large-class">large class</a>.</li>
<li>It's easy to add new state without effecting other types, because strategy-specific state is stored on a table for that strategy.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can view the entire refactor with all steps combined in the <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/ruby-science/compare/4939d3e3c539c5caaa36400d75258cc3f3f4e7d8...5f4a14ff6c43bf5b846d1c58d7509861c6fe3ac1">example app</a> to get an idea of what changed at the macro level.</p>
<p>This is a difficult transition to make, and the more behavior and data that you shove into an inheritance scheme, the harder it becomes. Regarding situations in which <a href="#single-table-inheritance-sti">STI</a> is not significantly easier than using a polymorphic relationship, it's better to start with composition. STI provides few advantages over composition, and it's easier to merge models than to split them.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="drawbacks-6" class="level3">
<h3><a href="#drawbacks-6">Drawbacks</a></h3>
<p>Our application also got worse in a number of ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>We introduced a new word into the application vocabulary. This can increase understanding of a complex system, but vocabulary overload makes simpler systems unnecessarily hard to learn.</li>
<li>We now need two queries to get a question's full state, and we'll need to query up to four tables to get information about a set of questions.</li>
<li>We introduced useless tables for two of our question types. This will happen whenever you use ActiveRecord to back a strategy without state.</li>
<li>We increased the overall complexity of the system. In this case, it may have been worth it, because we reduced the complexity per component. However, it's worth keeping an eye on.</li>
</ul>
<p>Before performing a large change like this, try to imagine what currently difficult changes will be easier to make in the new version.</p>
<p>After performing a large change, keep track of difficult changes you make. Would they have been easier in the old version?</p>
<p>Answering these questions will increase your ability to judge whether or not to use composition or inheritance in future situations.</p>

<p>This class contains all the behavior that formerly resided in the mixin. In order to keep everything working, we'll compose and delegate to the extracted class from the mixin:</p>

<span class="kw">end</span></code></pre>
<p></p>
<p>Next, we can replace references to the mixed in methods (<code>render_message_body</code> in this case) with direct references to the composed class:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="co"># app/models/message_inviter.rb</span>

<p>In our case, there was only one method to move. If your mixin has multiple methods, it's best to move them one at a time.</p>
<p>Once every reference to a mixed in method is replaced, you can remove the mixed in method. Once every mixed in method is removed, you can remove the mixin entirely.</p>

<p>In the above code, the <code>SurveyInviter</code> is simply creating <code>Invitation</code> records, and the actual delivery of the invitation email is hidden behind <code>Invitation.create!</code> via a callback.</p>
<p>If one of several invitations fails to save, the user will see a 500 page, but some of the invitations will already have been saved and delivered. The user will be unable to tell which invitations were sent.</p>
<p>Because delivery is coupled with persistence, there's no way to make sure that all the invitations are saved before starting to deliver emails.</p>
<p>Let's make the callback method public so that it can be called from <code>SurveyInviter</code>:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="co"># app/models/invitation.rb</span>
<span class="kw">def</span> deliver
  <span class="dt">Mailer</span>.invitation_notification(<span class="dv">self</span>).deliver
<span class="kw">end</span>

<span class="kw">private</span></code></pre>
<p>Then remove the <code>after_create</code> line to detach the method from persistence.</p>
<p>Now we can split invitations into separate persistence and delivery phases:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="co"># app/models/survey_inviter.rb</span>

<p>This controller accepts an <code>id</code> parameter identifying which summarizer strategy to use and renders a summary of the survey based on the chosen strategy:</p>

  <span class="kw">end</span>

  <span class="kw">private</span>

  <span class="kw">def</span> summarizer
    <span class="kw">case</span> params[<span class="st">:id</span>]
    <span class="kw">when</span> <span class="st">'breakdown'</span>
      <span class="dt">Breakdown</span>.new
    <span class="kw">when</span> <span class="st">'most_recent'</span>

    <span class="kw">else</span>
      raise <span class="st">&quot;Unknown summary type: </span><span class="ot">#{</span>params[<span class="st">:id</span>]<span class="ot">}</span><span class="st">&quot;</span>
    <span class="kw">end</span>
  <span class="kw">end</span>
<span class="kw">end</span></code></pre>
<p>The controller is manually mapping a given strategy name to an object that can perform the strategy with the given name. In most cases, a strategy name directly maps to a class of the same name.</p>
<p>We can use the <code>constantize</code> method from Rails to retrieve a class by name:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby">params[<span class="st">:id</span>].classify.constantize</code></pre>
<p>This will find the <code>MostRecent</code> class from the string <code>&quot;most_recent&quot;</code>, and so on. This means we can rely on a convention for our summarizer strategies: Each named strategy will map to a class implementing that strategy. The controller can <a href="#use-class-as-factory">use the class as an abstract factory</a> and obtain a summarizer.</p>
<p>However, we can't immediately start using <code>constantize</code> in our example, because there's one outlier case: The <code>UserAnswer</code> class is referenced using <code>&quot;your_answers&quot;</code> instead of <code>&quot;user_answer&quot;</code>, and <code>UserAnswer</code> takes different parameters than the other two strategies.</p>
<p>Before refactoring the code to rely on our new convention, let's refactor to obey it. All our names should map directly to class names and each class should accept the same parameters:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="co"># app/controllers/summaries_controller.rb</span>
<span class="kw">def</span> summarizer
  <span class="kw">case</span> params[<span class="st">:id</span>]
  <span class="kw">when</span> <span class="st">'breakdown'</span>
    <span class="dt">Breakdown</span>.new(user: current_user)
  <span class="kw">when</span> <span class="st">'most_recent'</span>
    <span class="dt">MostRecent</span>.new(user: current_user)
  <span class="kw">when</span> <span class="st">'user_answer'</span>
    <span class="dt">UserAnswer</span>.new(user: current_user)
  <span class="kw">else</span>
    raise <span class="st">&quot;Unknown summary type: </span><span class="ot">#{</span>params[<span class="st">:id</span>]<span class="ot">}</span><span class="st">&quot;</span>
  <span class="kw">end</span>
<span class="kw">end</span></code></pre>
<p></p>
<p>Now that we know we can instantiate any of the summarizer classes the same way, let's extract a method for determining the summarizer class:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="co"># app/controllers/summaries_controller.rb</span>
<span class="kw">def</span> summarizer
  summarizer_class.new(user: current_user)
<span class="kw">end</span>

<span class="kw">def</span> summarizer_class
  <span class="kw">case</span> params[<span class="st">:id</span>]
  <span class="kw">when</span> <span class="st">'breakdown'</span>
    <span class="dt">Breakdown</span>
  <span class="kw">when</span> <span class="st">'most_recent'</span>
    <span class="dt">MostRecent</span>
  <span class="kw">when</span> <span class="st">'user_answer'</span>
    <span class="dt">UserAnswer</span>
  <span class="kw">else</span>
    raise <span class="st">&quot;Unknown summary type: </span><span class="ot">#{</span>params[<span class="st">:id</span>]<span class="ot">}</span><span class="st">&quot;</span>
  <span class="kw">end</span>
<span class="kw">end</span></code></pre>
<p>The extracted class performs exactly the same logic as <code>constantize</code>, so let's use it:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="co"># app/controllers/summaries_controller.rb</span>
<span class="kw">def</span> summarizer
  summarizer_class.new(user: current_user)
<span class="kw">end</span>

<span class="kw">def</span> summarizer_class
  params[<span class="st">:id</span>].classify.constantize
<span class="kw">end</span></code></pre>
<p>Now we'll never need to change our controller when adding a new strategy; we just add a new class following the naming convention.</p>
</section>
<section id="scoping-constantize" class="level3">
<h3><a href="#scoping-constantize">Scoping <code>constantize</code></a></h3>
<p>Our controller currently takes a string directly from user input (<code>params</code>) and instantiates a class with that name.</p>
<p>There are two issues with this approach that should be fixed:</p>
<ul>
<li>There's no list of available strategies, so a developer would need to perform a complicated search to find the relevant classes.</li>
<li>Without a whitelist, users can make the application instantiate any class they want, by hacking parameters. This can result in security vulnerabilities.</li>
</ul>
<p>We can solve both easily by altering our convention slightly: Scope all the strategy classes within a module.</p>
<p>We change our strategy factory method:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="co"># app/controllers/summaries_controller.rb</span>
<span class="kw">def</span> summarizer
  summarizer_class.new(user: current_user)
<span class="kw">end</span>

<span class="kw">def</span> summarizer_class
  params[<span class="st">:id</span>].classify.constantize
<span class="kw">end</span></code></pre>
<p>To:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="co"># app/controllers/summaries_controller.rb</span>
<span class="kw">def</span> summarizer_class
  <span class="st">&quot;Summarizer::</span><span class="ot">#{</span>params[<span class="st">:id</span>].classify<span class="ot">}</span><span class="st">&quot;</span>.constantize
<span class="kw">end</span></code></pre>
<p>With this convention in place, you can find all strategies by just looking in the <code>Summarizer</code> module. In a Rails application, this will be in a <code>summarizer</code> directory by convention.</p>
<p>Users also won't be able to instantiate anything they want by abusing our <code>constantize</code>, because only classes in the <code>Summarizer</code> module are available.</p>

<h3><a href="#drawbacks-7">Drawbacks</a></h3>
<section id="weak-conventions" class="level4">
<h4><a href="#weak-conventions">Weak Conventions</a></h4>
<p>Conventions are most valuable when they're completely consistent.</p>
<p>The convention is slightly forced in this case because <code>UserAnswer</code> needs different parameters than the other two strategies. This means that we now need to add no-op <code>initializer</code> methods to the other two classes:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="co"># app/models/summarizer/breakdown.rb</span>
<span class="kw">class</span> <span class="dt">Summarizer</span>::<span class="dt">Breakdown</span>
  <span class="kw">def</span> initialize(options)
  <span class="kw">end</span>

  <span class="kw">def</span> summarize(question)
    question.breakdown
  <span class="kw">end</span>
<span class="kw">end</span></code></pre>
<p>This isn't a deal-breaker, but it makes the other classes a little noisier and adds the risk that a developer will waste time trying to remove the unused parameter.</p>
<p>Every compromise made weakens the convention, and having a weak convention is worse than having no convention. If you have to change the convention for every class you add that follows it, try something else.</p>
</section>
<section id="class-oriented-programming" class="level4">
<h4><a href="#class-oriented-programming">Class-Oriented Programming</a></h4>
<p>Another drawback to this solution is that it's entirely class-based, which means you can't assemble strategies at run-time. This means that reuse requires inheritance.</p>
<p>Also, while this class-based approach is convenient when developing an application, it's more likely to cause frustration when writing a library. Forcing developers to pass a class name instead of an object limits the amount of runtime information strategies can use. In our example, only a <code>user</code> was required. When you control both sides of the API, it's fine to assume that this is safe. When writing a library that will interface with other developers' applications, it's better not to rely on class names.</p>

<h1><a href="#dry">DRY</a></h1>
<p>The DRY principle—short for &quot;don't repeat yourself&quot;—comes from <a href="http://pragprog.com/book/tpp/the-pragmatic-programmer">The Pragmatic Programmer</a>.</p>
<p>This principle states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Following this principle is one of the best ways to prevent bugs and move faster. Every duplicated piece of knowledge is a bug waiting to happen. Many development techniques are really just ways to prevent and eliminate duplication, and many smells are just ways to detect existing duplication.</p>
<p>When knowledge is duplicated, changing it means making the same change in several places. Leaving duplication introduces a risk that the various duplicate implementations will slowly diverge, making them harder to merge and making it more likely that a bug remains in one or more incarnations after being fixed.</p>
<p>Duplication leads to frustration and paranoia. Rampant duplication is a common reason that developers reach for a grand rewrite.</p>
<section id="duplicated-knowledge-vs.-duplicated-text" class="level2">
<h2><a href="#duplicated-knowledge-vs.-duplicated-text">Duplicated Knowledge vs. Duplicated Text</a></h2>
<p>It's important to understand that this principle states that <em>knowledge</em> should not be repeated; it does not state that <em>text</em> should never be repeated.</p>
<p>For example, this sample does not violate the DRY principle, even though the word &quot;save&quot; is repeated several times:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="kw">def</span> sign_up
  <span class="ot">@user</span>.save
  <span class="ot">@account</span>.save
  <span class="ot">@subscription</span>.save
<span class="kw">end</span></code></pre>
<p>However, this code contains duplicated knowledge that could be extracted:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="kw">def</span> sign_up_free
  <span class="ot">@user</span>.save
  <span class="ot">@account</span>.save
  <span class="ot">@trial</span>.save

<span class="kw">def</span> sign_up_paid

<h1><a href="#single-responsibility-principle">Single Responsibility Principle</a></h1>
<p>The Single Responsibility Principle, often abbreviated as &quot;SRP,&quot; was introduced by Uncle Bob Martin, and states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A class should have only one reason to change.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Classes with fewer responsibilities are more likely to be reusable, easier to understand and faster to test. They are easy to change and require fewer changes after being written.</p>
<p>Although this appears to be a very simple principle, deciding whether or not any two pieces of behavior introduce two reasons to change is difficult, and obeying SRP rigidly can be frustrating.</p>
<section id="reasons-to-change" class="level3">
<h3><a href="#reasons-to-change">Reasons to Change</a></h3>
<p>One of the challenges in identifying reasons to change is deciding what granularity to be concerned with.</p>
<p>In our example application, users can invite their friends to take surveys. When an invitation is sent, we encapsulate that invitation in a basic ActiveRecord subclass:</p>
<p></p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="co"># app/models/invitation.rb</span>
<span class="kw">class</span> <span class="dt">Invitation</span> &lt; <span class="dt">ActiveRecord</span>::<span class="dt">Base</span>

  <span class="dt">STATUSES</span> =<span class="ot"> %w(</span><span class="st">pending accepted</span><span class="ot">)</span>

  belongs_to <span class="st">:sender</span>, class_name: <span class="st">'User'</span>
  belongs_to <span class="st">:survey</span>

  before_create <span class="st">:set_token</span>

  validates <span class="st">:recipient_email</span>, presence: <span class="dv">true</span>, format: <span class="dt">EMAIL_REGEX</span>
  validates <span class="st">:status</span>, inclusion: { <span class="kw">in</span>: <span class="dt">STATUSES</span> }

  <span class="kw">def</span> to_param
    token
  <span class="kw">end</span>

  <span class="kw">def</span> deliver
    body = <span class="dt">InvitationMessage</span>.new(<span class="dv">self</span>).body
    <span class="dt">Mailer</span>.invitation_notification(<span class="dv">self</span>, body).deliver
  <span class="kw">end</span>

  <span class="kw">private</span>

  <span class="kw">def</span> set_token
    <span class="dv">self</span>.token = <span class="dt">SecureRandom</span>.urlsafe_base64
  <span class="kw">end</span>
<span class="kw">end</span></code></pre>
<p>Everything in this class has something to do with invitations. We could make the blunt assessment that this class obeys SRP, because it will only change when invitation-related functionality changes. However, looking more carefully at how invitations are implemented, several other reasons to change can be identified:</p>
<ul>
<li>The format of invitation tokens changes.</li>
<li>A bug is identified in our validation of email addresses.</li>
<li>We need to deliver invitations using some mechanism other than email.</li>
<li>Invitations need to be persisted in another way, such as in a NoSQL database.</li>
<li>The API for ActiveRecord or ActiveSupport changes during an update.</li>
<li>The application switches from Rails to a new framework.</li>
</ul>
<p>That gives us half a dozen reasons this class might change, leading to the probable conclusion that this class does not follow SRP. So, should this class be refactored?</p>

<p>As a developer, you can anticipate likely changes based on your experience—or just common sense. For example, attributes and business rules for invitations are likely to change, so we know that this class will change as invitations evolve in the application.</p>
<p>Regular expressions are powerful but tricky beasts, so it's likely that we'll have to adjust our regular expression. It might be nice to encapsulate that somewhere else, such as in a <a href="#extract-validator">custom validator</a>.</p>
<p>It's not always helpful to speculate as to what delivery mechanisms may loom in the distant future, but it's not out of the realm of possibility that we'll need to send messages using an internal private messaging system, or another service like Facebook or Twitter. Therefore, it may be worthwhile to use <a href="#inject-dependencies">dependency injection</a> to remove the details of delivery from this model. This may also make testing easier and make the class easier to understand as a unit, because it will remove distracting details relating to email delivery.</p>
<p>NoSQL databases have their uses, but we have no reason to believe we'll ever need to move these records into another type of database. ActiveRecord has proven to be a safe and steady default choice, so it's probably not worth the effort to protect ourselves against that change.</p>
<p>Some of our business logic is expressed using APIs from libraries that could change, such as validations and relationships. We could write our own adapter to protect ourselves from those changes, but the maintenance burden is unlikely to be worth the benefit, and it will make the code harder to understand, since there will be unnecessary indirection between the model and the framework.</p>
<p>Lastly, we could protect our application against framework changes by preventing any business logic from leaking into the framework classes, such as controllers and ActiveRecord models. Again, this would add a thick layer of indirection to protect against an unlikely change.</p>
<p>However, if you're trying out a new database, object-relational mapper or framework, it may be worth adding some increased protection. The first time you use a new database, you may not be fully confident regarding that decision. Preventing any business logic from mixing with the persistence logic will make it easier to undo that decision and revert to a familiar solution like ActiveRecord in case the new database turns against you.</p>
<p>The less confident you are about a decision, the more you should isolate that decision from the rest of your application.</p>

<section id="cohesion" class="level2">
<h2><a href="#cohesion">Cohesion</a></h2>
<p>One of the primary goals of SRP is to promote cohesive classes. The more closely related the methods and properties are to each other, the more cohesive a class is.</p>
<p>Classes with high cohesion are easier to understand, because the pieces fit naturally together. They're also easier to change and reuse, because they won't be coupled to any unexpected dependencies.</p>
<p>Following this principle will lead to high cohesion, but it's important to focus on the output of each change made to follow the principle. If you notice an extra responsibility in a class, think about the benefits of extracting that responsibility. If you think noticeably higher cohesion will be the result, charge ahead. If you think it will simply be a way to spend an afternoon, make a note of it and move on.</p>
</section>
<section id="responsibility-magnets" class="level2">
<h2><a href="#responsibility-magnets">Responsibility Magnets</a></h2>
<p>Every application develops a few black holes that like to suck up as much responsibility as possible, slowly turning into <a href="#god-class">God classes</a>.</p>
<p><code>User</code> is a common responsibility magnet. Generally, each application has a focal point in its user interface that sucks up responsibility as well. Our example application's main feature allows users to answer questions on surveys, so <code>Survey</code> is a natural junk drawer for behavior.</p>
<p>It's easy to get sucked into a responsibility magnet by falling prey to &quot;Just-One-More Syndrome.&quot; Whenever you're about to add a new behavior to an existing class, first check the history of that class. If there are previous commits that show developers attempting to pull functionality out of this class, chances are good that it's a responsibility over-eater. Don't feed the problem; add a new class instead.</p>

<section id="tension-with-tell-dont-ask" class="level2">
<h2><a href="#tension-with-tell-dont-ask">Tension with Tell, Don't Ask</a></h2>
<p>Extracting reasons to change can make it harder to follow <a href="#tell-dont-ask">tell, don't ask</a>.</p>
<p>For example, consider a <code>Purchase</code> model that knows how to charge a user:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="kw">class</span> <span class="dt">Purchase</span>
  <span class="kw">def</span> charge
    purchaser.charge_credit_card(total_amount)
  <span class="kw">end</span>
<span class="kw">end</span></code></pre>
<p>This method follows <a href="#tell-dont-ask">tell, don't ask</a>, because we can simply tell any <code>Purchase</code> to <code>charge</code>, without examining any state on the <code>Purchase</code>.</p>
<p>However, it violates the SRP, because <code>Purchase</code> has more than one reason to change. If the rules around charging credit cards change or the rules for calculating purchase totals change, this class will have to change.</p>
<p>You can more closely adhere to SRP by extracting a new class for the <code>charge</code> method:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="kw">class</span> <span class="dt">PurchaseProcessor</span>
  <span class="kw">def</span> initialize(purchase, purchaser)
    <span class="ot">@purchase</span> = purchase
    <span class="ot">@purchaser</span> = purchaser
  <span class="kw">end</span>

  <span class="kw">def</span> charge
    <span class="ot">@purchaser</span>.charge_credit_card <span class="ot">@purchase</span>.total_amount
  <span class="kw">end</span>
<span class="kw">end</span></code></pre>
<p>This class can encapsulate rules around charging credit cards and remain immune to other changes, thus following SRP. However, it now violates <a href="#tell-dont-ask">tell, don't ask</a>, because it must ask the <code>@purchase</code> for its <code>total_amount</code> in order to place the charge.</p>
<p>These two principles are often at odds with each other and you must make a pragmatic decision about which direction works best for your own classes.</p>

<section id="tell-dont-ask" class="level1">
<h1><a href="#tell-dont-ask">Tell, Don't Ask</a></h1>
<p>The Tell, Don't Ask principle advises developers to tell objects what they want done, rather than querying objects and making decisions for them.</p>
<p>Consider the following example:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="kw">class</span> <span class="dt">Order</span>
  <span class="kw">def</span> charge(user)
    <span class="kw">if</span> user.has_valid_credit_card?
      user.charge(total)
    <span class="kw">else</span>
      <span class="dv">false</span>
    <span class="kw">end</span>
  <span class="kw">end</span>
<span class="kw">end</span></code></pre>
<p>This example doesn't follow <a href="#tell-dont-ask">tell, don't ask</a>. It first asks if the user has a valid credit card, and then makes a decision based on the user's state.</p>
<p>In order to follow <a href="#tell-dont-ask">tell, don't ask</a>, we can move this decision into <code>User#charge</code>:</p>
<p></p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="kw">class</span> <span class="dt">User</span>
  <span class="kw">def</span> charge(total)
    <span class="kw">if</span> has_valid_credit_card?

      <span class="dv">true</span>
    <span class="kw">else</span>
      <span class="dv">false</span>
    <span class="kw">end</span>
  <span class="kw">end</span>
<span class="kw">end</span></code></pre>
<p>Now <code>Order#charge</code> can simply delegate to <code>User#charge</code>, passing its own relevant state (<code>total</code>):</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="kw">class</span> <span class="dt">Order</span>
  <span class="kw">def</span> charge(user)
    user.charge(total)

<section id="tension-with-modelviewcontroller" class="level2">
<h2><a href="#tension-with-modelviewcontroller">Tension with Model—View—Controller</a></h2>
<p>This principle can be difficult to follow while also following Model—View—Controller (MVC).</p>
<p>Consider a view that uses the above <code>Order</code> model:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode rhtml"><code class="sourceCode rhtml"><span class="kw">&lt;%=</span> form_for <span class="ot">@order</span> <span class="kw">do</span> <span class="ch">|</span>form<span class="ch">|</span> <span class="kw">%&gt;</span>

  <span class="co">&lt;!-- Order Fields --&gt;</span>
<span class="kw">&lt;%</span> <span class="kw">end</span> <span class="kw">%&gt;</span></code></pre>
<p>The view doesn't display the credit card fields if the user already has a valid credit card saved. The view needs to ask the user a question and then change its behavior based on that question, violating <a href="#tell-dont-ask">tell, don't ask</a>.</p>
<p>You could obey <a href="#tell-dont-ask">tell, don't ask</a> by making the user know how to render the credit card form:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode rhtml"><code class="sourceCode rhtml"><span class="kw">&lt;%=</span> form_for <span class="ot">@order</span> <span class="kw">do</span> <span class="ch">|</span>form<span class="ch">|</span> <span class="kw">%&gt;</span>

  <span class="co">&lt;!-- Order Fields --&gt;</span>
<span class="kw">&lt;%</span> <span class="kw">end</span> <span class="kw">%&gt;</span></code></pre>
<p>However, this violates MVC by including view logic in the <code>User</code> model. In this case, it's better to keep the model, view and controller concerns separate and step across the <a href="#tell-dont-ask">tell, don't ask</a> line.</p>
<p>When writing interactions between other models and support classes, though, make sure to give commands whenever possible and avoid deviations in behavior based on another class's state.</p>

<section id="law-of-demeter" class="level1">
<h1><a href="#law-of-demeter">Law of Demeter</a></h1>
<p>The Law of Demeter was developed at Northeastern University. It's named after the Demeter Project, which was named after Demeter, the Greek goddess of the harvest. There is widespread disagreement as to its pronunciation, but the correct pronunciation emphasizes the second syllable; you can trust us on that.</p>
<p>This principle states that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A method of an object should invoke only the methods of the following kinds of objects:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>itself</li>
<li>its parameters</li>
<li>any objects it creates/instantiates</li>
<li>its direct component objects</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Like many principles, the Law of Demeter is an attempt to help developers manage dependencies. The law restricts how deeply a method can reach into another object's dependency graph, preventing any one method from becoming tightly coupled to another object's structure.</p>
<section id="multiple-dots" class="level2">
<h2><a href="#multiple-dots">Multiple Dots</a></h2>
<p>The most obvious violation of the Law of Demeter is &quot;multiple dots,&quot; meaning a chain of methods being invoked on each others' return values.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="kw">class</span> <span class="dt">User</span>
  <span class="kw">def</span> discounted_plan_price(discount_code)
    coupon = <span class="dt">Coupon</span>.new(discount_code)
    coupon.discount(account.plan.price)
  <span class="kw">end</span>
<span class="kw">end</span></code></pre>
<p>The call to <code>account.plan.price</code> above violates the Law of Demeter by invoking <code>price</code> on the return value of <code>plan</code>. The <code>price</code> method is not a method on <code>User</code>, its parameter <code>discount_code</code>, its instantiated object <code>coupon</code> or its direct component <code>account</code>.</p>
<p>The quickest way to avoid violations of this nature is to delegate the method:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="kw">class</span> <span class="dt">User</span>
  <span class="kw">def</span> discounted_plan_price(discount_code)
    account.discounted_plan_price(discount_code)
  <span class="kw">end</span>
<span class="kw">end</span>

<span class="kw">class</span> <span class="dt">Account</span>
  <span class="kw">def</span> discounted_plan_price(discount_code)
    coupon = <span class="dt">Coupon</span>.new(discount_code)
    coupon.discount(plan.price)
  <span class="kw">end</span>
<span class="kw">end</span></code></pre>
<p>In a Rails application, you can quickly delegate methods using ActiveSupport's <code>delegate</code> class method:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="kw">class</span> <span class="dt">User</span>
  delegate <span class="st">:discounted_plan_price</span>, to: <span class="st">:account</span>
<span class="kw">end</span></code></pre>
<p>If you find yourself writing lots of delegators, consider changing the consumer class to take a different object. For example, if you need to delegate numerous <code>User</code> methods to <code>Account</code>, it's possible that the code referencing <code>User</code> should actually reference an instance of <code>Account</code> instead.</p>
</section>
<section id="multiple-assignments" class="level2">
<h2><a href="#multiple-assignments">Multiple Assignments</a></h2>
<p>Law of Demeter violations are often hidden behind multiple assignments.</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="kw">class</span> <span class="dt">User</span>
  <span class="kw">def</span> discounted_plan_price(discount_code)
    coupon = <span class="dt">Coupon</span>.new(discount_code)
    plan = account.plan
    coupon.discount(plan.price)
  <span class="kw">end</span>
<span class="kw">end</span></code></pre>
<p>The above <code>discounted_plan_price</code> method no longer has multiple dots on one line, but it still violates the Law of Demeter, because <code>plan</code> isn't a parameter, instantiated object or direct subcomponent.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-spirit-of-the-law" class="level2">
<h2><a href="#the-spirit-of-the-law">The Spirit of the Law</a></h2>
<p>Although the letter of the Law of Demeter is rigid, its message is broader. The fundamental goal is to avoid over-entangling a method with another object's dependencies.</p>
<p>This means that fixing a violation shouldn't be your objective; removing the problem that <em>caused</em> the violation is a better idea. Here are a few tips to avoid misguided fixes to Law of Demeter violations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Many delegate methods to the same object are an indicator that your object graph may not accurately reflect the real-world relationships they represent.</li>
<li>Delegate methods with prefixes (<code>Post#author_name</code>) are fine, but it's worth a check to see if you can remove the prefix. If not, make sure you didn't actually want a reference to the prefix object (<code>Post#author</code>).</li>
<li>Avoid multiple prefixes for delegate methods, such as <code>User#account_plan_price</code>.</li>
<li>Avoid assigning to instance variables to work around violations.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="objects-vs.-types" class="level2">
<h2><a href="#objects-vs.-types">Objects vs. Types</a></h2>
<p>The version of the Law quoted at the beginning of this chapter is the &quot;object formulation,&quot; from the original paper. The first formulation was expressed in terms of types:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For all classes C, and for all methods M attached to C, all objects to which M sends a message must be instances of classes associated with the following classes:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The argument classes of M (including C).</li>
<li>The instance variable classes of C.</li>
</ol>
<p>(Objects created by M, or by functions or methods which M calls, and objects in global variables are considered as arguments of M.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This formulation allows some more freedom when chaining using a fluent syntax. Essentially, it allows chaining as long as each step of the chain returns the same type.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="co"># Mocking APIs</span>
user.should_receive(<span class="st">:save</span>).once.and_return(<span class="dv">true</span>)

<span class="co"># Ruby's Enumerable</span>
users.select(&amp;<span class="st">:active?</span>).map(&amp;<span class="st">:name</span>)

<span class="co"># String manipulation</span>

<span class="co"># ActiveRecord chains</span>
users.active.without_posts.signed_up_this_week</code></pre>
</section>
<section id="duplication" class="level2">
<h2><a href="#duplication">Duplication</a></h2>
<p>The Law of Demeter is related to the <a href="#dry">DRY</a> principle, in that Law of Demeter violations frequently duplicate knowledge of dependencies.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="kw">class</span> <span class="dt">CreditCardsController</span> &lt; <span class="dt">ApplicationController</span>
  <span class="kw">def</span> charge_for_plan
    <span class="kw">if</span> current_user.account.credit_card.valid?
      price = current_user.account.plan.price
      current_user.account.credit_card.charge price
    <span class="kw">end</span>
  <span class="kw">end</span>
<span class="kw">end</span></code></pre>
<p>In this example, the knowledge that a user has a credit card through its account is duplicated. That knowledge is declared somewhere in the <code>User</code> and <code>Account</code> classes when the relationship is defined, and knowledge of it then spreads to two more locations in <code>charge_for_plan</code>.</p>
<p>Like most duplication, each instance isn't too harmful; but in aggregate, duplication will slowly make refactoring become impossible.</p>

<section id="dynamic-vs.-static" class="level2">
<h2><a href="#dynamic-vs.-static">Dynamic vs. Static</a></h2>
<p>Although the two implementations are fairly similar, one difference between them is that, in the inheritance model, the components are assembled statically. The composition model, on the other hand, assembles the components dynamically.</p>
<p>Ruby is not a compiled language and everything is evaluated at run-time, so claiming that anything is assembled statically may sound like nonsense. However, there are several ways in which inheritance hierarchies are essentially written in stone, or static:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can't swap out a superclass once it's assigned.</li>
<li>You can't easily add and remove behaviors after an object is instantiated.</li>
<li>You can't inject a superclass as a dependency.</li>
<li>You can't easily access an abstract class's methods directly.</li>
</ul>
<p>On the other hand, everything in a composition model is dynamic:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can easily change out a composed instance after instantiation.</li>
<li>You can add and remove behaviors at any time using decorators, strategies, observers and other patterns.</li>
<li>You can easily inject composed dependencies.</li>
<li>Composed objects aren't abstract, so you can use their methods anywhere.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="dynamic-inheritance" class="level2">
<h2><a href="#dynamic-inheritance">Dynamic Inheritance</a></h2>
<p>There are very few rules in Ruby, so many of the restrictions that apply to inheritance in other languages can be worked around in Ruby. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can reopen and modify classes after they're defined, even while an application is running.</li>
<li>You can extend objects with modules after they're instantiated to add behaviors.</li>
<li>You can call private methods by using <code>send</code>.</li>
<li>You can create new classes at run-time by calling <code>Class.new</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>These features make it possible to overcome some of the rigidity of inheritance models. However, performing all of these operations is simpler with objects than it is with classes, and doing too much dynamic type definition will make the application harder to understand, by diluting the type system. After all, if none of the classes are ever fully formed, what does a class represent?</p>
</section>
<section id="the-trouble-with-hierarchies" class="level2">
<h2><a href="#the-trouble-with-hierarchies">The Trouble with Hierarchies</a></h2>
<p>Using subclasses introduces a subtle problem into your domain model: It assumes that your models follow a hierarchy; that is, it assumes that your types fall into a tree-like structure.</p>
<p>Continuing with the above example, we have a root type, <code>Inviter</code>, and two subtypes, <code>EmailInviter</code> and <code>MessageInviter</code>. What if we want invitations sent by admins to behave differently than invitations sent by normal users? We can create an <code>AdminInviter</code> class, but what will its superclass be? How will we combine it with <code>EmailInviter</code> and <code>MessageInviter</code>? There's no easy way to combine email, message and admin functionality using inheritance, so you'll end up with a proliferation of conditionals.</p>
<p>Composition, on the other hand, provides several ways out of this mess, such as using a decorator to add admin functionality to the inviter. Once you build objects with a reasonable interface, you can combine them endlessly with minimal modification to the existing class structure.</p>
</section>
<section id="mixins" class="level2">
<h2><a href="#mixins">Mixins</a></h2>
<p>Mixins are Ruby's answer to multiple inheritance.</p>
<p>However, mixins need to be mixed into a class before they can be used. Unless you plan on building dynamic classes at runtime, you'll need to create a class for each possible combination of modules. This will result in a ton of little classes, such as <code>AdminEmailInviter</code>.</p>
<p>Again, composition provides a clean answer to this problem, because you can create as many anonymous combinations of objects as your little heart desires.</p>
<p>Ruby does allow dynamic use of mixins using the <code>extend</code> method. This technique does work, but it has its own complications. Extending an object's type dynamically in this way dilutes the meaning of the word &quot;type,&quot; making it harder to understand what an object is. Additionally, using runtime <code>extend</code> can lead to performance issues in some Ruby implementations.</p>
</section>
<section id="single-table-inheritance" class="level2">
<h2><a href="#single-table-inheritance">Single Table Inheritance</a></h2>
<p>Rails provides a way to persist an inheritance hierarchy, known as <a href="#single-table-inheritance-sti">Single Table Inheritance</a>, often abbreviated as STI. Using STI, a cluster of subclasses is persisted to the same table as the base class. The name of the subclass is also saved on the row, allowing Rails to instantiate the correct subclass when pulling records back out of the database.</p>
<p>Rails also provides a clean way to persist composed structures using polymorphic associations. Using a polymorphic association, Rails will store both the primary key and the class name of the associated object.</p>
<p>Because Rails provides a clean implementation for persisting both inheritance and composition, the fact that you're using ActiveRecord should have little influence on your decision to design using inheritance versus composition.</p>
<section id="drawbacks-9" class="level3">
<h3><a href="#drawbacks-9">Drawbacks</a></h3>
<p>Although composed objects are largely easy to write and assemble, there are situations in which they hurt more than inheritance trees.</p>
<ul>
<li>Inheritance cleanly represents hierarchies. If you really do have a hierarchy of object types, use inheritance.</li>
<li>Subclasses always know what their superclass is, so they're easy to instantiate. If you use composition, you'll need to instantiate at least two objects to get a usable instance: the composing object and the composed object.</li>
<li>Using composition is more abstract, which means that you need a name for the composed object. In our earlier example, all three classes were &quot;inviters&quot; in the inheritance model, but the composition model introduced the &quot;invitation message&quot; concept. Excessive composition can lead to vocabulary overload.</li>
</ul>

<section id="openclosed-principle" class="level1">
<h1><a href="#openclosed-principle">Open/Closed Principle</a></h1>
<p>The Open/Closed Principle states that:</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The purpose of this principle is to make it possible to change or extend the behavior of an existing class without actually modifying the source code to that class.</p>
<p>Making classes extensible in this way has a number of benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Every time you modify a class, you risk breaking it, along with all classes that depend on that class. Reducing churn in a class reduces bugs in that class.</li>
<li>Changing the behavior or interface to a class means that you need to update any classes that depend on the old behavior or interface. Allowing per-use extensions to a class eliminates this domino effect.</li>
</ul>
<section id="strategies" class="level2">
<h2><a href="#strategies">Strategies</a></h2>
<p>It may sound appealing to never need to change existing classes again, but achieving this is difficult in practice. Once you've identified an area that keeps changing, there are a few strategies you can use to make it possible to extend without modifications. Let's go through an example with a few of those strategies.</p>
<p>In our example application, we have an <code>Invitation</code> class that can deliver itself to an invited user:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="co"># app/models/invitation.rb</span>
<span class="kw">def</span> deliver
  body = <span class="dt">InvitationMessage</span>.new(<span class="dv">self</span>).body
  <span class="dt">Mailer</span>.invitation_notification(<span class="dv">self</span>, body).deliver
<span class="kw">end</span></code></pre>
<p>However, we need a way to allow users to unsubscribe from these notifications. We have an <code>Unsubscribe</code> model that holds the email addresses of users that don't want to be notified.</p>
<p>The most direct way to add this check is to modify <code>Invitation</code> directly:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="co"># app/models/invitation.rb</span>
<span class="kw">def</span> deliver
  <span class="kw">unless</span> unsubscribed?
    body = <span class="dt">InvitationMessage</span>.new(<span class="dv">self</span>).body
    <span class="dt">Mailer</span>.invitation_notification(<span class="dv">self</span>, body).deliver
  <span class="kw">end</span>
<span class="kw">end</span></code></pre>
<p>However, that would violate the <a href="#openclosed-principle">open/closed principle</a>. Let's see how we can introduce this change without violating the principle.</p>
<p></p>
<section id="inheritance-1" class="level3">
<h3><a href="#inheritance-1">Inheritance</a></h3>
<p>One of the most common ways to extend an existing class without modifying it is to create a new subclass.</p>
<p>We can use a new subclass to handle unsubscriptions:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="co"># app/models/unsubscribeable_invitation.rb</span>
<span class="kw">class</span> <span class="dt">UnsubscribeableInvitation</span> &lt; <span class="dt">Invitation</span>
  <span class="kw">def</span> deliver
    <span class="kw">unless</span> unsubscribed?
      <span class="dv">super</span>
    <span class="kw">end</span>
  <span class="kw">end</span>

  <span class="kw">private</span>

  <span class="kw">def</span> unsubscribed?
    <span class="dt">Unsubscribe</span>.where(email: recipient_email).exists?
  <span class="kw">end</span>
<span class="kw">end</span></code></pre>
<p></p>
<p>This can be a little awkward when trying to use the new behavior, though. For example, we need to create an instance of this class, even though we want to save it to the same table as <code>Invitation</code>:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="co"># app/models/survey_inviter.rb</span>
<span class="kw">def</span> create_invitations
  <span class="dt">Invitation</span>.transaction <span class="kw">do</span>
    recipients.map <span class="kw">do</span> |recipient_email|
      <span class="dt">UnsubscribeableInvitation</span>.create!(
        survey: survey,
        sender: sender,
        recipient_email: recipient_email,
        status: <span class="st">'pending'</span>,
        message: <span class="ot">@message</span>
      )
    <span class="kw">end</span>
  <span class="kw">end</span>
<span class="kw">end</span></code></pre>
<p>This works adequately for creation, but using the ActiveRecord pattern, we'll end up with an instance of <code>Invitation</code> instead, if we ever reload from the database. That means that inheritance is easiest to use when the class we're extending doesn't require persistence.</p>
<p>Inheritance also requires some <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/ruby-science/commit/bf1ba7d2">creativity in unit tests</a> to avoid duplication.</p>
<p></p>
</section>
<section id="decorators" class="level3">
<h3><a href="#decorators">Decorators</a></h3>
<p>Another way to extend an existing class is to write a decorator.</p>
<p>Using Ruby's <code>DelegateClass</code> method, we can quickly create decorators:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="co"># app/models/unsubscribeable_invitation.rb</span>
<span class="kw">class</span> <span class="dt">UnsubscribeableInvitation</span> &lt; <span class="dt">DelegateClass</span>(<span class="dt">Invitation</span>)
  <span class="kw">def</span> deliver
    <span class="kw">unless</span> unsubscribed?
      <span class="dv">super</span>
    <span class="kw">end</span>
  <span class="kw">end</span>

  <span class="kw">private</span>

  <span class="kw">def</span> unsubscribed?
    <span class="dt">Unsubscribe</span>.where(email: recipient_email).exists?
  <span class="kw">end</span>
<span class="kw">end</span></code></pre>
<p>The implementation is extremely similar to the subclass but it can now be applied at run-time to instances of <code>Invitation</code>:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="co"># app/models/survey_inviter.rb</span>
<span class="kw">def</span> deliver_invitations
  create_invitations.each <span class="kw">do</span> |invitation|
    <span class="dt">UnsubscribeableInvitation</span>.new(invitation).deliver
  <span class="kw">end</span>
<span class="kw">end</span></code></pre>
<p>The unit tests can also be greatly simplified <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/ruby-science/blob/9084ee0c/example_app/spec/models/unsubscribeable_invitation_spec.rb">using stubs</a>.</p>
<p>This makes it easier to combine with persistence. However, Ruby's <code>DelegateClass</code> doesn't combine well with ActionPack's polymorphic URLs.</p>
</section>
<section id="dependency-injection" class="level3">
<h3><a href="#dependency-injection">Dependency Injection</a></h3>
<p>This method requires more forethought in the class you want to extend, but classes that follow <a href="#inversion-of-control">inversion of control</a> can inject dependencies to extend classes without modifying them.</p>
<p>We can modify our <code>Invitation</code> class slightly to allow client classes to inject a mailer:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="co"># app/models/invitation.rb</span>
<span class="kw">def</span> deliver(mailer)
  body = <span class="dt">InvitationMessage</span>.new(<span class="dv">self</span>).body
  mailer.invitation_notification(<span class="dv">self</span>, body).deliver
<span class="kw">end</span></code></pre>
<p></p>
<p>Now we can write a mailer implementation that checks to see if users are unsubscribed before sending them messages:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="co"># app/mailers/unsubscribeable_mailer.rb</span>
<span class="kw">class</span> <span class="dt">UnsubscribeableMailer</span>
  <span class="kw">def</span> <span class="dv">self</span>.invitation_notification(invitation, body)
    <span class="kw">if</span> unsubscribed?(invitation)
      <span class="dt">NullMessage</span>.new
    <span class="kw">else</span>
      <span class="dt">Mailer</span>.invitation_notification(invitation, body)
    <span class="kw">end</span>
  <span class="kw">end</span>

  <span class="kw">private</span>

  <span class="kw">def</span> <span class="dv">self</span>.unsubscribed?(invitation)
    <span class="dt">Unsubscribe</span>.where(email: invitation.recipient_email).exists?
  <span class="kw">end</span>

  <span class="kw">class</span> <span class="dt">NullMessage</span>
    <span class="kw">def</span> deliver
    <span class="kw">end</span>
  <span class="kw">end</span>
<span class="kw">end</span></code></pre>
<p>And we can use dependency injection to substitute it:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="co"># app/models/survey_inviter.rb</span>
<span class="kw">def</span> deliver_invitations
  create_invitations.each <span class="kw">do</span> |invitation|
    invitation.deliver(<span class="dt">UnsubscribeableMailer</span>)
  <span class="kw">end</span>
<span class="kw">end</span></code></pre>
</section>

<section id="everything-is-open" class="level2">
<h2><a href="#everything-is-open">Everything is Open</a></h2>
<p>As you've followed along with these strategies, you've probably noticed that although we've found creative ways to avoid modifying <code>Invitation</code>, we've had to modify other classes. When you change or add behavior, you need to change or add it somewhere. You can design your code so that most new or changed behavior takes place by writing a new class, but something, somewhere in the existing code will need to reference that new class.</p>
<p>It's difficult to determine what you should attempt to leave open when writing a class. It's hard to know where to leave extension hooks without anticipating every feature you might ever want to write.</p>
<p>Rather than attempting to guess what will require extension in the future, pay attention as you modify existing code. After each modification, check to see if there's a way you can refactor to make similar extensions possible without modifying the underlying class.</p>
<p>Code tends to change in the same ways over and over, so by making each change easy to apply as you need to make it, you're making the next change easier.</p>

<section id="monkey-patching" class="level2">
<h2><a href="#monkey-patching">Monkey Patching</a></h2>
<p>As a Ruby developer, you probably know that one quick way to extend a class without changing its source code is to use a monkey patch:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="co"># app/monkey_patches/invitation_with_unsubscribing.rb</span>
<span class="dt">Invitation</span>.class_eval <span class="kw">do</span>
  alias_method <span class="st">:deliver_unconditionally</span>, <span class="st">:deliver</span>

  <span class="kw">def</span> deliver
    <span class="kw">unless</span> unsubscribed?
      deliver_unconditionally
    <span class="kw">end</span>
  <span class="kw">end</span>

  <span class="kw">private</span>

    <span class="dt">Unsubscribe</span>.where(email: recipient_email).exists?
  <span class="kw">end</span>
<span class="kw">end</span></code></pre>
<p>Although monkey patching doesn't literally modify the class's source code, it does modify the existing class. That means that you risk breaking it, and, potentially, all classes that depend on it. Since you're changing the original behavior, you'll also need to update any client classes that depend on the old behavior.</p>
<p>In addition to all the drawbacks of directly modifying the original class, monkey patches also introduce confusion, as developers will need to look in multiple locations to understand the full definition of a class.</p>
<p>In short, monkey patching has most of the drawbacks of modifying the original class without any of the benefits of following the <a href="#openclosed-principle">open/closed principle</a>.</p>
<section id="drawbacks-10" class="level3">
<h3><a href="#drawbacks-10">Drawbacks</a></h3>
<p>Although following the <a href="#openclosed-principle">open/closed principle</a> will make code easier to change, it may make it more difficult to understand.

Although all of the three strategies outlined in this chapter are more flexible than the original change, directly modifying the class is the easiest to understand.</p>

<p>The principle states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A. High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.</p>
<p>B. Abstractions should not depend upon details. Details should depend upon abstractions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a very technical way of proposing that developers invert control.</p>

<h2><a href="#inversion-of-control">Inversion of Control</a></h2>
<p>Inversion of control is a technique for keeping software flexible. It combines best with small classes with <a href="#single-responsibility-principle">single responsibilities</a>. Inverting control means assigning dependencies at run-time, rather than statically referencing dependencies at each level.</p>
<p>This can be hard to understand as an abstract concept, but it's fairly simple in practice. Let's jump into an example:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="co"># app/models/survey.rb</span>
<span class="kw">def</span> summaries_using(summarizer, options = {})
  questions.map <span class="kw">do</span> |question|
    hider = <span class="dt">UnansweredQuestionHider</span>.new(summarizer, options[<span class="st">:answered_by</span>])
    question.summary_using(hider)
  <span class="kw">end</span>
<span class="kw">end</span></code></pre>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="co"># app/controllers/summaries_controller.rb</span>
<span class="kw">def</span> show
  <span class="ot">@survey</span> = <span class="dt">Survey</span>.find(params[<span class="st">:survey_id</span>])
  <span class="ot">@summaries</span> = <span class="ot">@survey</span>.summaries_using(summarizer, constraints)
<span class="kw">end</span></code></pre>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="co"># app/controllers/summaries_controller.rb</span>
<span class="kw">def</span> constraints
  <span class="kw">if</span> include_unanswered?
    {}
  <span class="kw">else</span>
    { answered_by: current_user }
  <span class="kw">end</span>
<span class="kw">end</span></code></pre>
<p>The <code>summaries_using</code> method builds a summary of the answers to each of the survey's questions.</p>
<p>However, we also want to hide the answers to questions that the user has not personally answered, so we <a href="#extract-decorator">decorate</a> the <code>summarizer</code> with an <code>UnansweredQuestionHider</code>. Note that we're statically referencing the concrete, lower-level detail <code>UnansweredQuestionHider</code> from <code>Survey</code> rather than depending on an abstraction.</p>
<p>In the current implementation, the <code>Survey#summaries_using</code> method will need to change whenever something changes about the summaries. For example, hiding the unanswered questions <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/ruby-science/commit/d60656aa">requires changes to this method</a>.</p>
<p>Also, note that the conditional logic is spread across several layers. <code>SummariesController</code> decides whether or not to hide unanswered questions. That knowledge is passed into <code>Survey#summaries_using</code>. <code>SummariesController</code> also passes the current user down into <code>Survey#summaries_using</code>, and from there it's passed into <code>UnansweredQuestionHider</code>:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="co"># app/models/unanswered_question_hider.rb</span>
<span class="kw">class</span> <span class="dt">UnansweredQuestionHider</span>
  <span class="dt">NO_ANSWER</span> = <span class="st">&quot;You haven't answered this question&quot;</span>.freeze

  <span class="kw">def</span> initialize(summarizer, user)
    <span class="ot">@summarizer</span> = summarizer
    <span class="ot">@user</span> = user
  <span class="kw">end</span>

  <span class="kw">def</span> summarize(question)
    <span class="kw">if</span> hide_unanswered_question?(question)
      <span class="dt">NO_ANSWER</span>
    <span class="kw">else</span>
      <span class="ot">@summarizer</span>.summarize(question)
    <span class="kw">end</span>
  <span class="kw">end</span>

  <span class="kw">private</span>

  <span class="kw">def</span> hide_unanswered_question?(question)
    <span class="ot">@user</span> &amp;&amp; !question.answered_by?(<span class="ot">@user</span>)
  <span class="kw">end</span>
<span class="kw">end</span></code></pre>
<p></p>
<p>We can make future changes like this easier by inverting control:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="co"># app/models/survey.rb</span>
<span class="kw">def</span> summaries_using(summarizer)
  questions.map <span class="kw">do</span> |question|
    question.summary_using(summarizer)
  <span class="kw">end</span>
<span class="kw">end</span></code></pre>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="co"># app/controllers/summaries_controller.rb</span>
<span class="kw">def</span> show
  <span class="ot">@survey</span> = <span class="dt">Survey</span>.find(params[<span class="st">:survey_id</span>])
  <span class="ot">@summaries</span> = <span class="ot">@survey</span>.summaries_using(decorated_summarizer)
<span class="kw">end</span>

<span class="kw">private</span>

<span class="kw">def</span> decorated_summarizer
  <span class="kw">if</span> include_unanswered?
    summarizer
  <span class="kw">else</span>
    <span class="dt">UnansweredQuestionHider</span>.new(summarizer, current_user)
  <span class="kw">end</span>
<span class="kw">end</span></code></pre>
<p>Now the <code>Survey#summaries_using</code> method is completely ignorant of answer hiding; it simply accepts a <code>summarizer</code> and the client (<code>SummariesController</code>) injects a decorated dependency. This means that adding similar changes won't require changing the <code>Summary</code> class at all.</p>
<p>This also allows us to simplify <code>UnansweredQuestionHider</code> by removing a condition:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="co"># app/models/unanswered_question_hider.rb</span>
<span class="kw">def</span> hide_unanswered_question?(question)
  !question.answered_by?(<span class="ot">@user</span>)
<span class="kw">end</span></code></pre>
<p>We no longer build <code>UnansweredQuestionHider</code> when a user isn't signed in, so we don't need to check for a user.</p>

<section id="where-to-decide-dependencies" class="level2">
<h2><a href="#where-to-decide-dependencies">Where To Decide Dependencies</a></h2>
<p>While following the previous example, you probably noticed that we didn't eliminate the <code>UnansweredQuestionHider</code> dependency; we just moved it around. This means that, while adding new summarizers or decorators won't affect <code>Summary</code>, they will affect <code>SummariesController</code> in the current implementation. So, did we actually make anything better?</p>
<p>In this case, the code was improved because the information that affects the dependency decision—<code>params[:unanswered]</code>—is now closer to where we make the decision. Before, we needed to pass a Boolean down into <code>summaries_using</code>, causing that decision to leak across layers.</p>
<p>If you push your dependency decisions up until they reach the layer that contains the information needed to make those decisions, you will prevent changes from affecting several layers.</p>
<section id="drawbacks-11" class="level3">
<h3><a href="#drawbacks-11">Drawbacks</a></h3>
<p>Following this principle results in more abstraction and indirection, as it's often difficult to tell which class is being used for a dependency.</p>
<p>Looking at the example above, it's now impossible to know in <code>summaries_using</code> which class will be used for the <code>summarizer</code>:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="co"># app/models/survey.rb</span>
<span class="kw">def</span> summaries_using(summarizer)
  questions.map <span class="kw">do</span> |question|
    question.summary_using(summarizer)
  <span class="kw">end</span>
<span class="kw">end</span></code></pre>
<p>This makes it difficult to know exactly what's going to happen. You can mitigate this issue by using naming conventions and well-named classes. However, each abstraction introduces more vocabulary into the application, making it more difficult for new developers to learn the domain.</p>

<section id="application-6" class="level3">
<h3><a href="#application-6">Application</a></h3>
<p>If you identify these smells in an application, you may want to adhere more closely to the <a href="#dependency-inversion-principle">dependency inversion principle</a> (DIP):</p>
<ul>
<li>Following DIP can eliminate <a href="#shotgun-surgery">shotgun surgery</a> by consolidating dependency decisions.</li>
<li>Code suffering from <a href="#divergent-change">divergent change</a> may improve after having some of its dependencies injected.</li>
<li><a href="#large-class">Large classes</a> and <a href="#long-method">long methods</a> can be reduced by injecting dependencies, as this will outsource dependency resolution.</li>
</ul>
<p>You may need to eliminate these smells in order to properly invert control:</p>
<ul>
<li>Excessive use of <a href="#callback">callbacks</a> will make it harder to follow the DIP, because it's harder to inject dependencies into a callback.</li>
<li>Using <a href="#mixin">mixins</a> and <a href="#single-table-inheritance-sti">STI</a> for reuse will make following the DIP more difficult, because inheritance is always decided statically. Because a class can't decide its parent class at run-time, inheritance can't follow inversion of control.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can use these solutions to refactor towards DIP-compliance:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#inject-dependencies">Inject dependencies</a> to invert control.</li>
<li>Use <a href="#extract-class">extract class</a> to make smaller classes that are easier to compose and inject.</li>
<li>Use <a href="#extract-decorator">extract decorator</a> to make it possible to package a decision that involves multiple classes and inject it as a single dependency.</li>
<li><a href="#replace-callback-with-method">Replace callbacks with methods</a> to make dependency injection easier.</li>
<li><a href="#replace-conditional-with-polymorphism">Replace conditional with polymorphism</a> to make dependency injection easier.</li>
<li><a href="#replace-mixin-with-composition">Replace mixin with composition</a> and <a href="#replace-subclasses-with-strategies">replace subclasses with strategies</a> to make it possible to decide dependencies abstractly at run-time.</li>
<li><a href="#use-class-as-factory">Use class as factory</a> to make it possible to abstractly instantiate dependencies without knowing which class is being used and without writing abstract factory classes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Following the <a href="#single-responsibility-principle">single responsibility principle</a> and <a href="#composition-over-inheritance">composition over inheritance</a> will make it easier to follow the <a href="#dependency-inversion-principle">dependency inversion principle</a>. Following this principle will make it easier to obey the <a href="#openclosed-principle">open/closed principle</a>.</p>
